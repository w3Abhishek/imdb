One night she comes home and after counting over her salary, turns over a certain amount to settle the meat bill. Her brother starts out with good intention, but ere he reaches his destination, he meets one of his friends and is persuaded to play a game of pool in which the boy loses his sister's money. He is ashamed to face those at home and steals in very late at night, thus evading an explanation. In the morning, however, he calls at the office where his sister is employed, determined to make a clean breast of it all. Here he is tempted by the sight of a twenty-dollar bill on the table and is caught in the act of stealing it by his sister who in turn is discovered by the man who loves her and rather than accuse her brother, she takes the guilt upon her own shoulders and is discharged. The boy's manhood is awakened and he confesses all which clears up everything.",
