The room he enters is in semi-darkness and in his excitement he knocks over a chair. After recovering from his fright he seeks for a suitable article to take with him and concludes that the portieres will do. He lights a match, and in the flare sees the face of a statue on a pedestal in front of him which puts him in a terrible scare. He backs into the piano, pulling the statue down, which falls crashing to the floor. The noise awakens Mr. and Mrs. Snow, he escaping downstairs, and she calling the police, but Snow's troubles had just begun, as Jones was on the job and finally succeeds in locking the frightened Snow up in a cabinet and escapes through the window just as the police enter the scene, and as a natural consequence, and for the good of the service, someone had to be arrested, so they take Snow, and the honor of the department is saved.",
