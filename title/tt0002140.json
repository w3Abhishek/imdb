  "Plot": "The sixth silent by Alfred Rolfe of which only fragments remain. There is evidence to suggest that this was one of his more popular movies and was especially successful in Sydney.Starring Charles Villiers, just about every directors choice for a the lead role in the early 1900's, the title is somewhat of a misnomer. The theme of the film in fact was the virtues of a good woman who goes to great pains to reform the ways of a confirmed drunkard. It should therefore arguably have been called DO WOMEN LOVE MEN?",
