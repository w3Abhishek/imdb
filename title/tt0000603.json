  "Plot": "The pen draws sketches which change themselves slowly. First, Napoleon is drawn, this evolves into Emperor William, who in turn changes to King Edward, wearing a silk hat and smoking a cigar. This turns into a fine likeness of the Father of Our Country, George Washington. Then the smoking lamp on a pedestal changes itself into a young lady in one of the new-style dresses and a large hat. Then there is a warning to engaged couples; the dude and his girl have the kissing habit and finally turn into a pair of ducks. Then a flower pot is drawn and a little package of seeds. The seeds fall into the flower pot, a watering can is drawn, then raises up and the water pours out and sprinkles the earth in the pot. The sun comes out and its rays cause the seeds to sprout and in a few seconds a beautiful lily is grown. The last sketch is just a circle, which changes shape until it becomes a picture of Bridget, the kitchen queen. The features then undergo a series of wonderful changes and, although it remains a complete picture throughout, finally turns into a society queen wearing a fashionable peach basket hat.",
