  "Plot": "Fresh air being ordered by the family physician, a young man takes his infirm father to the country, where he engages a furnished cottage next door to Judge Porter, who is the owner. It so happens that the young man and the judge's beautiful daughter were schoolmates and their renewed friendship soon develops into love, much to the judge's displeasure. The courtship continues nevertheless, and the lovers are frequently seen under a large peach tree, which grows between the two houses. As the judge prizes the tree very highly, his anger is thoroughly aroused when he catches the young man plucking the fruit and a warm dispute follows. Later, however, the judge relents and writes a note of apology, regretting his outburst of anger, and also stating that the young man is welcome to anything that falls on his side of the fence. These last words are the means of bringing the lovers together, for when the young lady falls on the other side of the fence in an attempt to pluck some peaches, the young man promptly picks her up, claiming her as his own, and proving his claim by the judge's own handwriting. The judge sees the point and gives them his blessing.",
