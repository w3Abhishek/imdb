  "Plot": "A dramatic episode during the Franco-Prussian war. Lady Florence is enamored of a young Prussian soldier. Count Lopes, an officer in the French army, also loves her, but is rejected. He suspects she loves another, and watches to find out who his rival may be. A Prussian spy has been tracked to the mansion, and the Count has reason to believe that he is the favored one, as he sees him enter her window. Following, the Prussian is hidden by Lady Florence in a closet, when the Count enters. He accuses her; she denies even on oath; but the Count detects her anxious look toward the closet. Considering it undignified to search, he plans a more subtle means. Calling two of his lieutenants, he pretends to test a new revolver, using a panel of the closet as a target, still giving her Ladyship a chance to present her lover; but she is obdurate and denies his accusation. Her Ladyship dispatches her maid to the upper floor to remove the trap door above the closet, but too late, for the shots are fired, and when the closet door is opened the sad truth is revealed. This is a subject most beautifully staged and acted with convincing discretion, as well as photographically perfect.",
