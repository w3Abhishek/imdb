  "Plot": "Without an heir, Mrs. Letitia Summers, the principal and proprietor of a most fashionable and exclusive boarding school, decides to give her two nieces an education and at the same time select one of them as her heir. Without letting them know who she is, she writes each a letter, stating that a lady of means has provided for their education at Mrs. Summers' seminary. Edith receives the announcement with joy. May, the other niece, who lives in another part of the country, is delighted with the news. Immediately she demands of her mother a lot of new things in order to satisfy her vanity and desire to make an impression. May, with her new clothes and outfit, attracts considerable attention when she arrives at the school. Edith, in her modest wardrobe and old-fashioned carpet bag, is received with disparaging remarks. At the end of the school course, the two girls graduate with creditable showing in their studies. After the graduating exercises, Mrs. Summers calls the two girls into her private office and tells them that she is their aunt, and she has chosen Edith as her heir in recognition of her kindness and thoughtfulness for others, particularly for her poor mother.",
