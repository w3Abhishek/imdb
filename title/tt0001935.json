  "Plot": "Little Zeetah, a daughter of an old chief of the Mississaugas, was stolen by a marauding warrior of the fiercer Ojibways, and grew up in his tribe, where her beauty won her endless suitors. To all she turned a deaf ear, and the young squaws, seeing how her attractions prevented the bucks from paying proper attentions to their charms, conspired to rid the village of her. Their opportunity came when she refused a proud voting chief, and they declared her a witch. She was sentenced to be sent adrift upon a rapid stream bound in a canoe where her fate was sure, for beneath the village were terrible falls. Just at this time, the old Mississauga chief sent his son, Lotokah, to the Ojibways with presents, and he, discovering his sister's identity by her totem mark, was able to save her and restore her to her mother's arms.",
