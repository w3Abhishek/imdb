  "Plot": "As evil incarnates in many forms--from horrible manifestations of pure darkness to light-bearing protectors--this time, the archfiend disguises himself as a righteous vicar to infiltrate a peaceful nunnery. Before long, his little sermon turns to pandemonium, scaring the nuns off the chapel, while attempting to establish his unholy presence in the house of God. However, the enemy is condemned to lose, as the omnipotent Celestial Guardian, the Archangel St. Michael, banishes the malevolent spirits back to the chasms of Hell, in a typical scene depicting the eternal battle between Good and Evil.",
