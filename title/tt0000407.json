  "Plot": "This seemingly simple and modest actuality from 1902 shows a religious parade. I was expecting much, until the first cut arrived, to be followed by a total of eleven. For 1902, this is highly advanced technique, something that was used by story films, but almost never by actualities.Actualities, the precursors of newsreels, purported to show you the reality, the whole reality and nothing but the reality. By using cuts, this one showed you the highlights. It assumed a greater understanding on the part of its audience than hitherto. It meant that cinema was growing up.",
