Her endeavors, however, are in vain, for he returns to their home in the evening in a beastly state of intoxication. The wife is nearly heartbroken, but their little son is highly amused at the antics of his drunken, besotted father, and the next day while the mother is at market, the children play at housekeeping with the boy as dad, he going through the performance enacted by his father on the day before. The father, now sober, views this from the next room, and it makes him so ashamed of himself that he swears to be done with drink for good, which oath he religiously keeps.",
