Can you imagine a more exciting or sensational picture than a great cattle stampede, curbed by fearless cowboys and dauntless riders of the western range horse? The roping and throwing of the longhorns, the invasion of the camp by the notable redskins, an ensemble picture of unusual merit, carrying with it a theme of love, hatred and revenge, making a picture so true to nature, simple in plot and construction that its advent will be a feature on any program. Two sisters own a large western ranch. Mary, the elder, is in love with Tom Mix, the County Sheriff, and the foreman of the ranch is displeased with her attentions to him and his actions make it necessary to discharge him; he then becomes a cattle rustler and arch enemy of the Sheriff. A raid is made on the ranch one night and a number are wounded. The Sheriff swears vengeance and organizes a posse to rid the country of the outlaw element.",
