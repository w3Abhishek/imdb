It was a favorite of mine growing up, at least in part because my mother would not let us have a dog.It has a very nice fairy-tale quality, with its immense and artificial dogs, some beautiful set design, and for the year in which it was made, some fine editing that made the events evident to anyone who knew the story..... which was just about everyone in Denmark, the country where this was produced.",
