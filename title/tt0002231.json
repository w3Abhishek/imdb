A man of whims, he is in a measure infatuated with her. Being in poor health, owing to heart trouble, he is cautioned by his physician against undue excitement, hence none of his own household try to thwart him when he proceeds to fascinate the girl. Of course, his nature being capricious, he soon tires of the pretty senorita and the pledge he bestowed proves worthless. Fearing the scorn of her father, she leaves his house. Her former sweetheart tells her father of his suspicion and the old man goes to the orange grower, but he pleads in vain. It is then that both the boy and her father vow vengeance. Fate intervenes, however, for the man dies, a victim of heart failure. Later the poor girl is drawn back home where she finds a father's heart yearning for her return.",
