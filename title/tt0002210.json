Alice arrives while Will is away from the house and goes to her room to sleep. Jack, who has looked upon the wine when it was much too red, comes to the house and tries to get into Alice's room. She chases him out and Will comes home to find his friend shivering in the hallway. Jack explains that some woman threw him out of the room. Not knowing of Alice's presence, Will is very much wrought up. He knocks on the door of her room. Alice, thinking the inebriate, Jack, has returned, opens the door and throws a pitcher of water all over Will. Confusion reigns, until matters are straightened out by proper introductions and regrets.",
