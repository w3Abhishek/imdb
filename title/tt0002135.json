The dancer's efforts are met with a storm of applause from the deacon, who meets the girl after the show and becomes badly smitten, and in a moment of weakness is persuaded to have his tintype taken with the girl in costume. Some time later the show hits the deacon's home town, and the Purity League tries to prevent the performance. The arguments with the management reach an exciting stage, when the girl comes up and shows the picture of the deacon. The leaguers turn upon him, strip him of his badge and assist his wife in teaching him a thorough lesson.",
