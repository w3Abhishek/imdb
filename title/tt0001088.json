  "Plot": "Tom Horne deeply loved pretty little Mabel Jarrett, and that his love was returned goes without saying. Tom's ebullient ambition is intensified by his great love for the girl, so he decides to go out west to fight for fame and fortune to be more worthy of her. After some time in the land of promise he succeeds in attaining the end for which he had striven and writes of his intention to return and claim her for his own. Meanwhile, Mabel's cousin Winnie has visited her and is to spend the summer months. At the receipt of Tom's letter, Mabel is in the seventh heaven of delight, when cruel fate plunges her into the depths of despair, for a horrible accident occurs. During the evening, while Mabel is in the act of lighting the lamp, it explodes, frightfully burning her face and head. It is conclusive that the poor girl will be disfigured for life. What a blow it is to her almost on the eve of Tom's return! They all try to cheer her, although fully realizing her sad plight. Winnie in particular does her best to allay her anticipating fears. However, Tom arrives and is dreadfully shocked at Mabel's appearance. This wounds Mabel, but he makes an effort to dissemble and make her believe that the awful scar will make no difference; will not lessen his affection for her, or dissipate his desire to make her his wife. But, ah, mere words are empty, and poor Mabel can see a tinge of repugnance in his attitude, and discerns a decided attachment between her cousin and Tom. Winnie realizes this also, and tries to leave the place to be out of the way. Mabel discovers this sacrificial move on the part of Winnie and prevents it by making the sacrifice herself. Leaving a note bidding all farewell, and hoping Tom and Winnie will be married, she goes from the house and makes her way to the coast. Placing her cloak and hat on the high rocky cliff, she hides, so they at once assume she has jumped into the sea. When they have left for the house, all mourning the brave girl as dead, she then goes and enlists her services at an orphan asylum to take care of the poor, homeless foundlings. Later Tom and Winnie are happily married, both holding a tender, reverent remembrance for the brave self-sacrificing girl whom they imagine buried in the dark waters of the remorseless, restless sea.",
