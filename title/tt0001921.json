Dick disguises himself as an old woman, and owing to the attorney's benevolent nature, Dick finds it easy to gain entrance into the house by feigning illness. The lawyer is in the house with only the boy, who is in his own room on the second floor. It looks for a time that Dick will be successful in perpetrating his dire design, but the boy suggests that his father lower him by a rope from the window. This is a perilous move, but the boy bravely undertakes it. The youngster once outside, races off and brings a couple of mounted police to the rescue.",
