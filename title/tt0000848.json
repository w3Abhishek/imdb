When he has disposed of them, his armor which he has laid aside seems to have become inhabited by a peculiar being with limbs that stretch yards in length. The armor then falls to the ground and a beautiful maiden is disclosed. She suddenly becomes a butterfly, and as the knight approaches her, the wings of the butterfly give way to the huge tentacles of a giant spider or octopus, which reach out for Don Quixote and try to grasp him. He reaches for his spear, but it fades from view, and he awakens only to find himself savagely attacking Sancho Panza, his faithful but luckless man-servant.",
