  "Plot": "Strange as it may seem the poor tramp, who is the hero of this Biograph comedy, finds it hard indeed to get pinched. There is no doubt he could have gotten work, but it is against the rules of his order. The cold weather is pretty trying and he wishes to get under cover, if it has to be in the \"jug,\" so commits most ignoble and lawless deeds, but without success. The police simply ignore him, and often arrest an unoffending person in his stead. He becomes guilty of theft, assault, riot, disorderly conduct, and, in fact, everything but murder, but is still a bird of freedom. It's no use, so despondently he makes his way to the woodyard, resolving to go to work, when a copper meets him at the gate and arrests him, just when he didn't want it.",
