Major Pitt, summoned to the front, leaves Bugler Harkness alone in charge of headquarters. During the battle that follows, Battery B bears the brunt of the fight and does not surrender until almost the last man is killed. A cavalry charge carries the day for the Federal troops and the triumphant northerners, advancing upon the town, receive an unexpected check at the Colwell Mansion. A cannon that has been left at headquarters owing to an accident to one of its wheels, is operated by Bugler Harkness and the girls to such good effect that the Federals are compelled to retreat. A visit from Stonewall Jackson, who has been a distant witness of the brave boy's work, transforms the bugler to a lieutenant.",
