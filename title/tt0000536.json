  "Plot": "The Apache dance had the reputation of the \"Dance of the Underworld\". There were no set steps or routines, instead Habanera or Tango music was often acted pantomimically and dancers. During the dance, the women were often very close and firmly embraced, and artistic actions, as they later reappear in Lindy Hopp, were part of it. The dances that were identified with the apache dance beyond the variety dance in the bars and dance cafes were varied. There is no surviving spelling of this dance as a salon dance or \"social dance\". The diversity of the listed dances rather leads to the conclusion that \"Apache\" stands as a label for a Parisian subculture that existed in the environment of music cafes and small dance halls and in the dance fever of the time to the adaptation of just certain fashion dance and led regional styles.",
