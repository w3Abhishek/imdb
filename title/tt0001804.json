  "Plot": "First some examples of palming are given, and then the conjurer cuts an orange in half and closes it with the pulp undisturbed. Opening the orange again, he shows that all the pulp has gone, a duster having taken its place. A number of tricks with colored balls follow and a very effective section shows milk poured into a bowl from one glass and then claret added from another. Then comes the surprise, the claret suddenly leaves the milk with which it had been mingled and the milk follows, each liquid going back into the glass in which it was at first.",
