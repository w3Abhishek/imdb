A friendship was established between the young men, and was only interrupted by news of war between the two countries. Later, George was appointed on the staff of General Braddock with his friend, Col. George Warrington, and was wounded at the disastrous ambush in which Braddock and nearly all his force were killed. He was on the point of being scalped when he was saved by Florac, and sent to Fort Duquesne, where he was at the mercy of a drunken old scoundrel of a sergeant, from whom he finally escaped through the kindness of an Indian squaw, the toy of Sgt. Museau, whom he had befriended and shielded from the latter's violence.",
