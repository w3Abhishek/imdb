Schneider goes home to prepare his poetic effusion and is interrupted by the arrival of his sister Lena and her young son Fritz. Now the trouble begins. First Fritz teases the parrot until its squawking annoys Schneider and he cannot write; next it is the phonograph, then a trombone, etc. However, night comes and all is still, when, hark, our friend is startled by mysterious footfalls. Investigating he finds burglars have entered the house, but they are musically inclined and have gathered together the above mentioned instruments of torture, phonograph, trombone, parrot, etc. Hence, Schneider not only helps them on their way, but pays them for what he esteems a blessing.",
