Miss Pauline Smith is forelady of the factory, and the girls, jealous of her, plan a practical joke, by placing one of her cards in a pair of overalls which they are getting ready for shipment. The overalls are later on purchased by a rube who is recognized as the village Beau Brummel. He, finding the card, becomes \"chesty,\" and immediately writes the following letter to the fair unknown: \"Dear Miss, I found your name and address in a pair of overalls I just bought. Suppose we round up this romance by us two getting married. I know I could love you. Just say the word. Jay Downs.\" This letter is delivered by the mail carrier to the girl, who is highly indignant and answers: \"Dear Sir, I don't want a silly noodle who gets mashed on a girl he never saw. I don't know how my card got in those overalls. I want a fellow who can afford something better than a 47c. pair of breeches. Yours respectfully, Pauline Smith.\" Result, conceit gets a jolt.",
