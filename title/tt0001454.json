  "Plot": "Diplomacy is one of the most valuable traits in a man's make-up. By it he loses nothing and often gains much; besides, it prevents trouble. When we are in our 'teens, diplomacy stands as good in love's young dream. Tom did not possess this quality and when May showed to him her latest painting Tom said \"Punk,\" for in truth he was anxious to discourage her hobby for painting, knowing full well that she would never become a great artist. Howard, his rival, was more diplomatic. He praised her efforts, and is at once the top-notcher in May's esteem. This perturbs Tom, and he at once plans to trip Howard up. Disguised as a tramp, he, with the butler's assistance, steals the painting and in the presence of May tries to sell it to Howard, who, not recognizing it as May's, calls it \"the worst ever.\" May, however, knows her own handiwork, and seizing the canvas bids them \"beat it\" for as regards her they are both in the \"in bad\" class.",
