  "Plot": "A stern father rules his little family by what he thinks to be the Bible's precepts, but it is simply the influence of his own narrow mind, he forgetting entirely his own youth. Hence when his boy suggests going to a barn dance, he flies into a rage and commands that the boy remain at home. The boy, however, becomes rebellious and goes, and for this act of disobedience the father drives him from the house and forces the rest of the family to swear never to mention his name again. A short time later they move to a new neighborhood, and the boy's sister meets and marries the village blacksmith. The old father has often regretted his harshness to the boy, but his stubborn nature prevents his admitting it. The sister, though, realizes his feelings and writes to her brother, who begs to come home. This almost causes trouble of another nature, for the blacksmith, who knew nothing of the brother, saw his wife in the apparent stranger's arms, and suspicious, was about to leave without asking an explanation.",
