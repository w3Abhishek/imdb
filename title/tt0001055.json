  "Plot": "The remnants of this early G.M. Anderson film may be viewed in the Library of Congress collection. Moving Picture World reviewed the film in 1909, saying that \"The Essanay people have made some excellent films depicting life and scenes in the West. The latest from their studio has many elements of attractiveness, yet it fails to convince. While the action of the characters is undoubtedly substantially as it would be in real life, still the story is not convincing. The setting is unusually good. The scenery pictorially is unsurpassed by anything the Essanay people have done.\" The unsurpassed scenery is today known as Colorado's world-famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre and Park. The existing footage from the film consists solely of the chase sequences through the park and nearby Bear Creek. Apparently some exhibitor decided to toss the unconvincing plot and keep the unsurpassed scenery!",
