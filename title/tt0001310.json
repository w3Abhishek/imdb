  "Plot": "As water seeks its level, so affinities will find their own, no matter what the conditions. The quartet comprising this story are of ages as the months are to each other. June, a young college boy, finds his resources in depletion, and to improve his financial condition, proposes to October, a wealthy spinster of the \"where-is-he\" stage, and is accepted with avidity, and so these two soul \"mis\"-mates start their engagement inning. Later, December, a wealthy old bachelor, proposes to May, a pretty miss of eighteen, and the promise of fine gowns, jewels and automobiles, so dear to the heart of the fair sex, induces her to accept with half-hearted tolerance, hence they also start the engagement period. Everything goes finely until the quartet meet. Well, May, under a subterfuge, gets December to go an errand for her, as does June with October, so when the Autumn months return they find the Spring months in their proper order or sequence, side by side, so there is nothing left for December and October but to make the best of it, and folded in each other's arms they set the fatal, that is the festal, day for some time in November.",
