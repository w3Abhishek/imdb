So they consented to cut the cards, and the one drawing the highest would get the girl they loved. Richard loses, but only for a time. While he was riding out of the country to forget about the lady and everything else, his horse tripped, giving him a hard knock on the head. At this psychological moment, the lady Richard and Henry were fighting for, happens to be riding past in her automobile. She tenderly picks the man up and takes care of him. Henry soon learned that he was not the winner of the prize after all, so he tore up the agreement he had made with Richard. It is needless to say that the young lady's name is now Mrs. Richard Gray.",
