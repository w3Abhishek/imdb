  "Plot": "Some ballet dancers go into action with costumes that suggest dragonflies.It's a nice short for the period, although the modern viewer may consider it pointless. Viewed in the context of several dance shorts of the period, which were labeled as \"Butterfly dancers\" and featured extensive had coloring, it shows up as a nice variant.My sources indicate that it was actually shot by. Albert Kirchner ad acquired by Gaumont, which is why it is usually attributed to Alice Guy.",
