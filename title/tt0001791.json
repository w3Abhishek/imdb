  "Plot": "Here is a new and original working out of the slipper plot and Cinderella gets the prince by a route that is delightfully different. We see her, allured by the waves on the beach and secure in her solitude, slip off shoes and stockings to go in wading. And then appears the prince in the guise of a most attractive summer man, and she runs to hide her feet under her skirts, leaving one shoe and stocking on the sands. Embarrassed at her predicament, she disclaims ownership when he offers them, and so with a smile, he goes away with the shoe and stocking in his pocket. Then, to add insult to injury, he tells everyone he meets about his find, and that he thought they belonged to a certain Miss Cinderella, who dodges an introduction to him. Everybody at the hotel asks her about the matter and she grows hot and desperate at having to fib so often. Finally her chance comes. Camp Arcady, where the prince lives, is left alone one day, and she rows across to it, determined to regain her property. But our hero is watchful and returns. Cinderella is caught apparently robbing the camp, and dare not say why she is there. But when the handcuffs are brought from his trophies on the reach pole, she gives up. Then he makes her prove ownership by fitting the slipper to her foot.",
