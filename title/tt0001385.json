The girl is adopted by a well-to-do farmer and his wife, who raise her as their own. One day when the girl has grown into a lovely young woman, she meets a prosperous and handsome older man through a strange twist of fate. They fall in love and are engaged to be married. On the very day of the wedding the poor mother wanders to the farmer's house. She sees a picture of her daughter as a three year old and recognizes her. Learning that the girl is to be married that day, the mother rushes to the church. When she arrives there she and the groom recognize one another, and immediately they both realize that Ben has nearly married his own daughter. But the shock is too much for the mother, and she dies in her husband's arms.",
