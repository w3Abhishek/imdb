  "Plot": "The 34 year old D.W. Griffith may know how to paint a moving image picture, but he knows nothing about character development and plotting. The formula that he uses in this film is antiquated and does not make entertaining viewing. There is no diversity in this piece whatsoever, and the story that he has to tell lacks crispiness. This offering suffers from its absence of colour. The fresh air is stifled through the narrative, the selection of characters and the heavy emphasis on technical experimentation. It should have been left on the drawing board because it has nothing to offer audiences in terms of entertainment and enjoyment.",
