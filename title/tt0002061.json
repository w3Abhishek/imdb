In going over the plans of their new bungalow they are interrupted by Kitty's little sister, Eleanor, who manages to destroy the precious plans and is sent from the room by Billy. Eleanor plots revenge and next day while they are playing tennis on the lawn, puts some of Kitty's lingerie in the pocket of Billy's coat. Kitty finds it, breaks off her engagement, and her father drives Billy from the premises. A little later Eleanor finds a packet of love letters that Kitty has left on the lawn and decides to play \"post office\" with them. Consequently the precious missives are distributed to every mail-box on the street. Kitty misses them and is told by Eleanor of their whereabouts. In horror Kitty rushes to Billy, informs him of the matter and an excited chase up and down the street follows. Most of the neighbors are found reading the tender epistles, and they are only turned over to the lovers after much merriment at their expense. However, the last one is finally received and Billy takes Kitty home, where the affair of the lingerie is straightened out. The broken engagement is renewed once more.",
