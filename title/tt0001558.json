  "Plot": "These two farm boys imagined that the best way to make an impression upon their sweethearts was to pose as heroes, and so they schemed. The plan they adopt is getting an old suit of clothing stuffed out with straw, and placing it under a bush with the booted feet protruding, to appear as if a man were sleeping there. It looks sinister enough and frightens the girls when they pass the spot. The girls rush off and tell the boys, who armed with a rifle go to meet the intruder, but meanwhile Happy Jack, the tramp, has happened along, and appropriating the clothes, takes the place of the dummy, showing distinct signs of life at the approach of the would-be heroes. The movement of the supposed inanimate figure throws the boys into a panic of fright, and dropping their gun they make tracks for the house to the disgust of the girls.",
