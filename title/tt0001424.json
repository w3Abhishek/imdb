  "Plot": "The most absolutely new and original western story ever put in picture form. We find a little mountain tavern near the foothills where the cowboys and rangers were wont to spend their spare time when they were not chasing a steer. One nice summer day the camp was all in a turmoil; the stage had arrived and among its occupants was a young lady, demure and sweet. Several of the residents thereabout and a smooth looking chap of the city type who afterwards proves to be a vendor in cheap jewelry and is out for the harvest. Nell, the young lady in question, establishes a school in art recognizing in the cowboy clientele excellent material to further her scheme. She soon has them all paying marked homage, willing to take lessons just in order to admire their teacher. They are suddenly seized with the idea of making her presents of rings and jewelry, little dreaming that the (dark horse) man in the background selling rings was none other than her husband. Things assume an exceedingly interesting state of affairs.",
