  "Plot": "It appears that \"Amor que mata\" was first made by Frutuos Gelabert's for Cebra Films in 1909, and then reworked (?) in 1911 with Joan Codina for Barcelona films, with the same actors Joaquim Carrasco, Vicente Sirvent and Jos\u00e9 Vives. I have seen a copy of this 11 minute melodrama of love, jealousy and revenge in the Filmoteca in Madrid. The copy has a number of intertitles, signed Tibadabo Films, and letters that are shown on the screen to intensify and complicate the situation. In the copy viewed held by the Filmoteca nacional, these are all in English. And a reference is made to the Savoy Hotel, London, in spite of the fact that the film shows (Valencian) palm trees outside the window of the hotel. This confirms the fact that Spanish films were being exported in those early days (see Segundo de Chomon Ruiz's \"Hotel electrico\"). Interesting is that one of the letters included in the film is dated \"London, 15th March 1914\" - suggesting that the film was given its English subtitles for export at a time of great upheavals in Europe outside Spain.",
