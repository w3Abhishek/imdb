In the studio flats living room the bourgeois family is disturbed by smoke coming through the wall and they call handy man Raimu and his off-sider, who demolish a wall to solve the problem, getting themselves and the room covered with dust, soot and plaster.Played with broad gestures in wide shot.The version on You Tube is reasonable quality and has been tinted. Modern optical transitions (wipes and irises) make it hard to estimate the original pacing or length. The would-be comic sound effects are best turned off.",
