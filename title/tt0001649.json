  "Plot": "John Lacy had everything that a man could desire, including wealth and the love of a girl. One day there was a panic in the stock market and Lacy's wealth was wiped out. So great was the shock that he determined to end his life. But he wanted to have one last dance with his sweetheart, so he calmly dressed and proceeded to a ball. While he was gone burglars broke into his house. Lacy discovered them on his return home when he turned on the light in the library. The intruders tried to escape, but found two policemen in the street near the house. Then they were startled to find Lacy pick up a pistol and to hear him announce that he was about to end his own life. Realizing that if he did so, the policemen would hear the shot and accuse them of the crime, so they seized Lacy and gagged him. Then one of them discovered on the table the farewell note which he had written to his sweetheart, and they decided to telephone to her, since they could not escape in any other way. She came quickly and released Lacy, who then conducted the burglars safely past the policemen; everything ends happily.",
