A little later the manager has occasion to ask for them. He discovers that one is missing and placing the blame upon the clerk, discharges him. He goes home in despair to his wife and child. It is difficult to secure work, and bills are coming in quickly. As his little boy is walking down the street, a gust of wind blows his hat off, and it rests on the spot where lies a pocket-book, containing a large amount of money. The young fellow brings the money to his father, who discovers that it belongs to his former employer. It is returned, and as the manager is writing the man's name on a piece of paper, a gust of wind blows it under the old clock, where he finds the missing bond. It is needless to say that both employee and manager are soon together again.",
