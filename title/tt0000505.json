  "Plot": "Some boys sneak up on a woman sleping on a park bench and tie a string of balloons to her hair. Away goes the balloon, away goes the hair, revealing the woman is bald, away goes the woman in pursuit, away go the bystanders.Andr\u00e9 Deed, who would become better known as an assortment of comic characters like Boireau and Cretinetti plays the woman in a bald wig.. It's a standard chase comedy, even to the scene shot with a roottop background. It does have some sense in the plot, and lacks the huge and boisterous and rather mysterious objects that would come to set off these chases.",
