  "Plot": "This is going to be an unusual commentary. I've certainly never done this before. But I really feel I saw this movie in a previous life. (Of course I could have seen part of it on a TV Documentary many years ago.) Whenever I saw it, it was very sweet and charming. The scenes were mostly dark. The lighting wasn't very good. The sets weren't so good either. But it had an ethereal quality like a true fairy tale from a time long ago. I think I liked the actress who played Cinderella. She had a lot of presence for those days. I must have been young when I saw it. It captured my imagination and the warm feeling stayed with me for many years.",
