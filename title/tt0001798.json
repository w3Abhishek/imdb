  "Plot": "Jim Barker, an old Kentucky moonshiner, has two children, a young girl and boy. Janey, the girl, is in love with Dave Williams, who is working with her father at the still, but she refuses to marry him until he gives up moonshining. Dave agrees to do so and endeavors to persuade young Jim, Janey's brother, to do likewise. Jimmie pleads to his father, and after receiving a thrashing from the old man, takes revenge in informing the revenue officers of the location of the still. Jimmie then goes to Dave's cabin, confesses, and is hidden in the garret of the cabin, when Barker and the other moonshiners arrive in search for him. Dave himself is about to be lynched when Jimmie comes down from his hiding place and gives himself up. The lynching of the boy is avoided by the girl, who has learned of her lover and brother's peril and who brings the revenue men in time to save their lives.",
