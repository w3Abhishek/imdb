The temptation is too great for the unlucky prospector and he follows the arrowmaker to a cave, kills him, and starts across the Colorado desert with the ill-gotten gold. The arrowmaker's daughter finds her father's body and a clue to the murderer. She takes up the trail and in turn is followed by her Indian lover, who assumes that she is in love with the white man. The prospector and the girl are soon in agony because of a lack of water, but little by little the girl overtakes him, and, exhausted, they can go no farther. The Indian, with a supply of water, arrives in time to resuscitate the girl. The murderer proffers them the gold for a sip of water, but the offer is spurned, and together they watch him die.",
