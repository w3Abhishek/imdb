  "Plot": "Jack, after traveling to the West to better his mother's failing health and make his fortune, is quite discouraged when he finds that he is unable to locate a mine. He is refused employment at \"Double Circle Ranch.\" As he is leaving the place, he meets the ranchman's daughter and they are mutually impressed with each other. The owner of the ranch receives a letter saying that cattle-rustlers are operating in the vicinity. On his way home Jack accidentally walks into the camp of the cattle thieves. After questioning him, he is given employment, which he accepts, much against his will. Intent on his work, he does not see the ranchman's daughter approaching from behind. She covers him with her revolver, but Jack tells her his troubles. Still suspicious, the girl proceeds to the hut occupied by he and his mother, and finding things corresponding with Jack's words, she gives money to his mother. Relieved of immediate worries, Jack goes back to his mining ventures and strikes it rich. One day as Jack was visiting the ranchman's daughter, a creditor called upon the now ruined owner with a bill, which he was unable to meet. Jack, however, returned the favor of the girl, by closing the account.",
