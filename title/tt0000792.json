The dentil of the first horn, at the age of two, left the couple almost inconsolable, and the little toy dog, which the baby held in its arms, in its last moments, was indeed a cherished remembrance. Seven years after the husband became so deeply engrossed in his business affairs as to neglect to some extent his wife and second child, a girl of six. The wife complaining of his indifference, a quarrel ensues. She decides to leave him. Arrangements for a separation are made, and a division of effects takes place. Everything is disposed of when the little girl picks up the toy dog of her dead and gone brother, and says, \"Mamma, who takes this?\" Well the scene that transpires defies description and it is sufficient to say that it is the most touching episode ever portrayed. The separation does not take place.",
