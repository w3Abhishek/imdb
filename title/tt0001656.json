  "Plot": "Mrs. Browne has three admirers. One is a poor man, one aspires to be a fortune hunter and the third is one of those bogus counts. She causes to be inserted in the newspapers that she has met with an accident that will disfigure her for life, and also that her financial standing is swept away by speculation. Then she writes her three admirers, informing them that they can consider her double misfortune as a release from their attentions. She receives three replies to her communications. The fortune hunter and the bogus count write of their regrets over her misfortune and thank her for her consideration of them. The poor man calls on her with the intention of doing his utmost to diminish her grief, but his mission is at once changed for he finds her hale and hearty with a bankroll as healthy as herself. Of course, the newspaper item at once takes a more romantic shade, that of the engagement notice of Mrs. Browne and the only man who wooed her and got her fortune.",
