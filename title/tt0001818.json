She sits continually weeping over the child's little garments, and despite her husband's efforts to cheer her, she persists in indulging in this moroseness. Her husband, therefore, is forced to seek more agreeable companionship outside his own home, and in time the wife appreciates his indifference. She complains to her mother, who tells her she alone is to blame, and if she doesn't change she will lose his love altogether. The wife realizes the strength of this advice, and determines to win her husband back. However, the awakening has come too late, for her husband has formed an attachment for a vivacious young widow. More subtle plans must be formed, and she succeeds in fascinating him at a dance they both attend, by arousing his jealousy.",
