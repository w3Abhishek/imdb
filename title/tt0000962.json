  "Plot": "The experience of Tantalus was never so chafing as a tantalizing sweetheart. The strength of this is better understood when we realize the impetuous nature of the Latin type of person. The Senorita, to tease her sweetheart, pretends love for an American soldier, and for a while it looks as if the little detachment of soldiers would be forced to bestow the last military honors on one of their number. However, by a clever trick, Senorita rights the impending wrong; the soldier escapes without a scar, and the sweethearts are left enjoying their cigarettes. This subject, while being short, is one of the most beautiful pieces of high-class acting ever attempted, the leading character being played by a native Spaniard.",
