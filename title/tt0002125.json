  "Plot": "The story of \"Curfew\" tells of a soldier who deserted his post during wartime to keep a tryst with his sweetheart. Having left his post of duty, he was considered to be a deserter and was court martialed forthwith. The soldier was condemned to die. His sweetheart endeavored to intercede for him with the commanding officer, but the commander was firm and austere. To set the soldier free would have been, a bad example; therefore, he was condemned to die at the ringing of the curfew bell. Having exhausted all means of securing a pardon for her lover, the maiden resorted to a last desperate chance, which, though seemingly futile, was a chance. She climbed to the belfry of the tower where the curfew bell hung, and there by hanging upon its huge clapper prevented it from sounding when the old deaf bell-ringer came to ring the parting day. The bell-ringer bad officially rung the bell and yet it had not sounded. Therefore the young soldier waiting to be shot was legally dead, although he still lived, when the old sexton had finished his work.",
