  "Plot": "Jake Walters and his wife, Millie, arrive at Lizardhead, Arizona. They have learned that Mrs. Riley, proprietress of the hotel, has advertised for a waitress and Millie is sent to take the position. Millie is pretty and soon has all the village swains breaking their necks to gain her favor. From \"Stump\" Willetts to \"Lank\" Henderson, every cowboy within a radius of ten miles of Lizardhead is led to believe that he is the pretty lady's choice. At this moment Jake gets his cue, and loading himself down with a dozen volumes of \"How to Make Love,\" he meets \"Stump\" Willetts and ropes him into buying up all the books that Jake has with him in the belief that these are all that the agent has, and that it would be unprofitable for him to let the books fall into other hands. At fancy prices, Jake sells the other lovers the books in dozen lots, who are also led to believe that they have a corner on the market. All the lovers propose to Millie, each referring to his text book, and with each Millie discretely reserves her answer. It is then that Jake, disguised as a sheriff enters and arrests Millie, whom, he says, is wanted for bigamy. Not until Jake and Millie have caught the end of a departing train do the boys realize how completely they have been stung.",
