Unable to resist the hopelessness of her position the girl sinks to the lowest depths of misery, where she is found some time later by Marten, in seeking a model for a picture to depict the misery of the hopeless. The artist hopefully begins his task, which is soon interrupted by the violent death of Hanna's father, at whose bier she vows to lead a better life in the strength of her new resolve Hanna strives for better things, regains the love of Hans, improves her condition and begins again to experience the joys of a new life, which drives the expression of hopelessness from her face.
