On the way home from the bazaar the auto breaks down and Mary in her gypsy costume decides to walk on. Jack arriving by train also decides to walk. On the way he spies a gypsy camp. Further on he encounters Mary, who has hurt her ankle. He is smitten by her beauty and asks her if she belongs to the gypsy camp he has just seen. She says no and escapes, dropping a side comb. He picks it up and decides to find her again. He comes to the house and meets the family, including Mary, but does not recognize her in her ordinary costume. He goes in search of the camp, but it has obeyed the calling of the highway, and flown. Mary by this time learns to love this handsome guest, but cannot understand his strange conduct. By accident she finds her comb in his pocket and divines the delightful truth. She therefore plans a masquerade party. He attends and on a seat under an ancient tree pops the ancient question in a deluge of rain.",
