After Smith has made himself obnoxious to a couple of his wife's friends, whom he has not met before, they decide to lay a trap for him and teach him a lesson. They flirt with him deliberately, and go to the park with him. Here one manages to make her escape, and runs back to Mrs. Smith. The other makes a fool out of him, and finally gets him to play \"Blind Man's Buff\" and ties a handkerchief over his eyes. As he is groping about for his fair companion, Mrs. Smith slips into his arms. He tears the handkerchief from his eyes and faces the music.",
