Chickens roost on the back of the sofa; a large pig finds pleasure on the parlor rug; monkeys skip merrily from chair to chair and from chandelier to curtain pole. Rabbits, guinea pigs, cats, lap dogs, white mice and calves, gambol in beautiful fellowship around the floor. About the only place Mr. Pussy can find to deposit his weary limbs is the roof, or down in the cellar. Once in a while he tries to sit on the mantelpiece, but is usually aroused by the ourang-outang, who claims this as his particular place. One day, in a spirit of deep, dark -blooded revenge, Mr. Pussy decides to give Mrs. Pussy the surprise of her life, and so he comes home with a wild and ferocious leopard, and turns him loose in Mrs. Pussy's parlor zoo. 'Nuff said!",
