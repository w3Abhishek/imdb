  "Plot": "From time immemorial Bluebeard has been one of the most fascinating stories of childhood days. Children of all climes have listened breathlessly to every word of its recital, until the characters have assumed the guise of reality and every word of its narration has sunk deep into lasting memory. Fatima and sister Anne have seemed like living people to their minds, from the time that Fatima, in her mother's lonely hut, accepts the invitation to visit Bluebeard's castle until, after marrying him, he is about to behead her for entering the room where he keeps the heads of his former wives. Time after time, too, they have cheered when Fatima's two brothers rush in, and inwardly rejoice when they dispatch the wicked Bluebeard, just in time to save poor Fatima's life. All this has been pictured by the Edison Company in a manner that will amuse the little ones, and give the older generation many happy thoughts and pleasant memories of their own childhood days when fairy tales held undisputed sway.",
