  "Plot": "A pretty little pastoral, beautifully set and admirably acted. It shows how one slight, thoughtless action may discover the true nature of a man, and dash to atoms his fondest hopes. Nellie's hand is sought by a twain of swains. One is a simple farmer lad, while the other is a handsome, dressy chap, who has lived in the city. As appearances are everything, the city chap is the favored one, until one day a hunter shoots a dove which he leaves wounded in the road. Nellie witnesses this occurrence with grieved heart, but the worst comes when her dandy suitor passes, sees the bird and kicks it aside. A moment later the farmer boy approaches and picking up the dove carries it caressingly away in his straw hat. This decides her. The simple lad wins the day.",
