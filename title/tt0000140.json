  "Plot": "Fisherman at the Stream, The (1897) Bathing in a Stream (1897)Serpentine Dance by Mme. Bob Walter (1897) *** (out of 4)Three early films from Gaumont Studios and director Alice Guy. The first film, THE FISHERMAN AT THE STREAM has a group of boys playing a prank on a fisherman by pushing him into the water. BATHING IN A STREAM, apparently shot at the same time as our first film, has the boys taking a bath in that stream while SERPENTINE DANCE BY MME. BOB WALTER, running the longest at 107-seconds, is pretty much a direct remake of ANNABELLE SERPENTINE DANCE from Edison. Out of the three films from this year in Kino's collection, the first one is probably the best but none of them really feature Guy breaking out onto her own as all three seem to \"borrow\" a lot of previous films from Melies and Edison. The third film is probably the weakest of the bunch as we've seen in from various studios and it has probably already grown quite tiresome even in this early part of cinema, although people back then were obviously eating it up.",
