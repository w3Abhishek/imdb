  "Plot": "A film purporting to be this lost M\u00e9li\u00e8s film is no such thing. It is Robert W. Paul's Up the River of the same year. It is sometimes supposed (see Wikipedia) that the two=part M\u00e9li\u00e8s film was inspired by Paul's film but there is no real evidence of this either. Both are however clearly early examples of docufiction.",
