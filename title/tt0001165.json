She is cold and hungry, and Lawrence sits her down before the lunch spread for him, but which he has not touched. It happens that Miss Thurston drops in at the studio at this time and, finding the flower girl and aware that she is not a model, leaves abruptly in a huff. Under the influence of her mother (who has long been cheated on by Mr. Thurston), Florabel is about to break off the engagement. The flower girl however, learning of the trouble she has innocently caused, hastens to put things right. Explanations bring a reconciliation of Ben and Florabel.",
