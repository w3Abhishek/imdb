While there, he, out of sheer loneliness, pays considerable attention to the little Mexican girl, at whose home he is a roomer. The girl falls deeply in love with the American, who wins her absolute confidence. When the time comes for his departure, he of course cannot take her with him, and when he says goodbye, she realizes how false were his promises. Her love for the Americano now turns to bitter hate, and she agrees to marry her erstwhile sweetheart, whom she threw aside for the American, if he will avenge her wrong. This he consents to do and so follows the American to a nearby town. A boom is on and the American leaves his room at the hotel to go to the Land Office on business, leaving the gas lighted until his return. The Mexican enters to wait, and not knowing anything about gas, blows it out so as to attack in the dark. When the American returns he finds that vengeance has gone awry. At the same time, the girl, who has repented her impulsiveness, enters and sees the result of it. Still, love was to blame, and the American makes all possible reparation.",
