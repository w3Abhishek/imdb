A body of disgruntled grouches band together in view of shuffling off this mortal coil in a spectacular manner. With this object to the fore the Suicide Club of America holds its monthly meeting to select the next candidate for mortuary honors. Lots are drawn and Frank Fairmount picks the fatal card \"23.\" The President then presents Frank with the necessary skidoo instruments, a pistol, a dagger, a bottle of poison and a rope, and wishes him success. Frank arrives home at the same time as a letter addressed to him which informs him that he has fallen heir to $50,000. Now to commit suicide under these conditions is out of the question. The members are very much upset by not seeing notice of Frank's demise in the newspaper, so they go in a body to ascertain the cause. Frank meets them with a paper to sign releasing him from his oath, but they indignantly refuse until he closes the door and turns on the gas. Now while they would speed the parting guest, they are loath to go with him, so they sign.",
