  "Plot": "John Farley, to his mother's regret, is a ne'er-do-well fellow. One day he takes from a drawer the money as rent to his mother, the caretaker of the premises. He is the cause of suspicion being cast upon his innocent parent and her ultimate ejection from her home and position of trust. The poor woman has to struggle on alone, and manages to eke out a bare existence by very rough work, ending deeper into the mire on the road to ruin. John one night proceeds with a companion to break into a house. Searching around the room, he has failed to discover anything of the slightest value, but is almost struck helpless by the sight of a portrait hanging upon the wall of the meagerly furnished apartment. With a shock he recognizes it as that of his father, and is so overcome that he drives his companion away, determined that he will never again commit such sins. While in an attitude of penitence, he is surprised by the entry of his poor wearied mother, who has returned from her daily toil almost worn out with fatigue. The influence of a good father has been sufficient to recall the better nature of John into activity. He discards his bad associates and becomes the support and comfort of his poor old mother for the remainder of her days.",
