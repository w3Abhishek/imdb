  "Plot": "He had no thought, but to work and save money. His poor wife did nothing but drudge, with no return other than an existence. This cannot last; it poisons one's spirit in time. Bay after day it was work, without an affectionate word or glance from her husband, who always met her plea for a new hat or dress with the expression, \"We cannot afford it; we must save our money. Besides, your hat and dress are good enough.\" One day, a young man stops at the farmhouse to get a drink of water. He imagines from her sad face that all is not as it should be, and tells her that her eyes are too beautiful for tears and her hands too delicate to carry the burdens set for her. The husband sees and hears and is at last made to realize that her life, without the sunshine of love, is but a little better than death, and so he makes a change for the better.",
