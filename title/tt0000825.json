A children's quarrel ensues and the party is divided. Gladys, Pearl and baby go in one direction, the rest in the other. The trio sit on the edge of a sand pit playing with their dove when there is a cave-in and all three go to the bottom. In vain they try to get out, but fail. Meanwhile their absence has been felt, and a searching party is scouring the neighborhood. Pearl conceives the idea of making a messenger of their bird, so tying a note to its neck, sends it off. It flies home; their whereabouts are discovered and they are soon rescued from their perilous situation.",
