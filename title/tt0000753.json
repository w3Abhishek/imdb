  "Plot": "Mr. Si Green was a prosperous young farmer who felt the need of a wife to share his joys and sorrows and to minister over his lonesome household. Being of a romantic turn of mine, knowing his Laura Jean Libby thoroughly, he was not content to woo and win one of the country lasses of his neighborhood, but adopted the fanciful method of advertising for a wife, by writing on an egg among those he was carrying to market. This egg was purchased by one of a party of college girls who discover the inscription while preparing a little chafing dish feast in their dormitory. You no doubt may anticipate the outcome. One of them answers it and arranges a meeting, which Si joyously attends, attired in his best go-to-meeting duds. The fair maid proposes a stroll along the shady country lane. They are followed by the other girls and when seated on a stump the girls rush up, bind the poor fellow with a rope and fasten him to the barn. Here they indulge in a little target practice, using eggs as ammunition and him as the target. Oh, what a sorry sight he is when their supply is exhausted. He looks like a Spanish omelette.",
