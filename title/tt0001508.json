A poor poet has humbly loved the princess, but considers himself unworthy until the Child Equality argues differently. Lord Gold in rage kills the Child Equality and the poet loses hope. However, when the princess sleeps the poor poet steals a kiss. The princess sees, and through the poet's kiss. Lord Selfish would kill the poet, but he is thwarted by justice, as the poet goes singing to his apparent death. Justice takes him to the princess' side.",
