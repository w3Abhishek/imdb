  "Plot": "Will Talbot, a miner, is severely injured in an explosion of dynamite on his claim and his life is saved through the aid of his faithful Indian servant. The Indian carries him to their shack and rides to town for the doctor. When the latter arrives he finds that Talbot has not only suffered severe face burns, but seems to have also lost all knowledge of his identity, a species of insanity occasionally the result of a violent shock. The doctor sets about picking the bits of stone and powder from his patient's face, when to his surprise he finds among the fine particles a few grains of god dust. Talbot has made a strike! The scheming doctor plans to cheat the stricken miner out of the rich claim, but his inquiries from the Indian result in failure. Later the doctor returns with a following of town bullies who endeavor to wring a confession from the Indian through torture. Knocked down by a stiff blow from the butt end of the doctor's revolver he rises again, his memory restored. Single-handed, he fights the bullies and wins, driving them from the house. The incident results in Talbot giving the faithful Indian a partnership in the valuable claim.",
