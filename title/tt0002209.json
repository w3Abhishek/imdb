She offers him no encouragement and the persistent drummer sends her a note, asking her to meet him. Eve shows the note to some of the trainmen who declare that the drummer should be taught a lesson. The drummer is therefore advised by Eve that she will meet him near the water tank and when he arrives the girl induces him to stand under the spout. Eve steps back as the trainmen turn on the water and the drummer is given a severe ducking. Next day while walking down the track, the drummer discovers the caboose at the top of a steep grade and he determines to be revenged. He releases the caboose, expecting to alight but it gains headway and dashes down the grade. The trainmen seeing the runaway car, uncouple the engine and dash in pursuit. After a thrilling chase the runaway caboose is overtaken and proper punishment is meted out to the drummer.",
