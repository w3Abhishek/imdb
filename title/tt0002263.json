  "Plot": "The Illumination depicts the last days of Christ, His death and burial, in and about Jerusalem under the Roman rule and occupancy during the reign of Caesar. The story is that of Joseph, a young Jew, who is led to believe in Christ through His miraculous power and spiritual influence among men. He is denounced by his family and friends, but he continues to follow the Nazarene, and shows such purity and sanctity of mind and character that they, too, become followers of Jesus. Even the imperturbable Roman centurion, Maximus, who would have killed the Christ, is brought under His gentle influence. After the crucifixion, as He uttered His last words: \"It Is finished!\" the Temple of Jerusalem is rent. A great darkness pervades the earth. The heavens pour out lurid flashes of light as if searching the uttermost corners of the globe to lead them to the truth and pointing the way. Scoffers and unbelievers hasten to do homage at His tomb.",
