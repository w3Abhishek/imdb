They go divergent roads, and are soon widely separated one from the other, but they grow lonesome and try to find each other's whereabouts, without success. We lose sight of Bill and Dick is seen up against it good and hard. For him the future looks like a chalk ring on a blackboard, until he happens to saunter along the Bowery, where the manager of a dime museum offers him a job to play the gorilla. It looks good so he accepts. It is pretty sort until the astute impresario decides to pull off an innovation: that is, a gorilla and lion in the same cage. Of course Dick objects most strenuously to this arrangement, but his objections are quailed with a treacherous looking run, so he is forced to share the same menagerie hallroom with the lion. Now the lion is as frightened at the gorilla as the gorilla is at the lion, for they are both fakes. On discovering each other's harmlessness they both decide to mutiny, and upon throwing aside their disguise they, no, yes, it is, Dick, Bill, and they are in each other's arms.",
