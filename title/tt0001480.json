Black Dog, a worthless Indian, passing through the ranch riding a crow-bait pony, exchanges for one of the ranch horses. Riding off, he takes his way toward town. Passing Arizona Bill's house he sees Bill's handsome horse tied outside and concludes he will make another exchange. Shortly after the departure of the Indian from the ranch one of the cowboys discovers the loss of his horse and rides in pursuit. Reaching Bill's home he finds the horse tied outside and accuses Bill of stealing it. While this is going on Nancy, the rancher's daughter, has ridden off to the far section of the range to inform her father of the theft of the horse. The father, accompanied by a number of the cowboys, starts after the thief. Bill succeeds in getting away from his captor and rides for the hills, but is pursued by Steve, who eventually gets the drop on him and compels him to walk in front of his horse toward town. In the meantime Bill's wife sees the Indian thief and recognizes her husband's horse. At the point of a gun she effects a capture and rides in with the Indian just in time to rescue Bill from an extremely serious situation.",
