However, when you are a beautiful, cheerful, and tall grasshopper, you have all the time in the world to have fun with your friends, and work is nothing but a waste of time. But, now that chilly autumn has arrived and the leaves begin to fall from the trees, the frivolous grasshopper, who hasn't worked a day in his life and has spent the entire summer singing and dancing, is starting to see the error of his ways. Will the hard-working ant lend the grasshopper a helping hand?",
