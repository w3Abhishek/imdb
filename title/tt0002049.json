  "Plot": "Bartlow joins Stuart's Confederate brigade. A year later the Federals are holding Pottsburg Creek Bridge near Bartlow's old home. Bartlow plans to burn the bridge and interrupt the Federals' line of communication. To aid in the scheme a party of Stuart's brigade attack the sentries to hold their attention while Bartlow accomplishes his mission, but on the way to the bridge, Bartlow is discovered by a sentry and badly wounded. He manages to get ashore and reach his home. Jessie, his sister, dressing in a suit of his clothes, finally reaches the bridge, sets fire to it and escapes. In the meantime Stuart's men have drawn the Federals in force across the bridge. Quickly retreating, the Confederates blow up the end of the bridge. The Federals thus are caught between two fires, and to save their lives are obliged to jump into the water and swim for shore, where they are quickly made prisoners by Stuart's men who are waiting for them along the banks.",
