A few weeks later Tom writes Alice that he has struck it rich and for her to accompany her father on the stagecoach that day and she can ride with him to the claim office. In the meantime, the Riley boys, a gang of roughs, have learned of Percival's rich strike and plan to jump the tenderfoot's claim. They persuade the bartender at the inn to \"fix\" Lacey's whiskey, planning to beat the coach to the claim office. However, they have not reckoned with Tom and Alice. Alice, when she finds her father made unconscious by the \"knockout drops,\" drives the six horses herself and with Tom perched on the rear end of the coach to keep back the Rileys, they ride to the claim office and the claim is filed.",
