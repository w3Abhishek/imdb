Dressing herself in his clothes, she enlists in the Confederate army but is recognized by an old friend, Lieutenant Lightfoot, who promises to keep her secret. The morning of a great battle arrives. Col. Summers, a Federal officer, is ordered to place a gun on the extreme left flank. The company of which Alma is the drummer is ordered to silence this Federal cannon which is dealing out a veritable hail of death. The Confederates charge, drive off the Federals, and Alma, though wounded, succeeds in spiking the gun. Alma is picked up from the field by Northern soldiers and taken to a Federal hospital. Two weeks later an exchange of prisoners brings about a double wedding.",
