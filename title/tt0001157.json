In the States, at that time, guerrillas, better known as \"unlawful warfarers,\" were the pest and fear of both North and South. We see a Southern family gathering, interrupted by this fearful band. Their behavior in the home brings to the rescue of her mistress the old negro mammy, the family cook, who is daunted by nothing. A secret message is dispatched by the young daughter to Col. Morgan's camp, the anxious household awaiting with bated breath the result. The child, determined to reach her father, is wounded by a picket before her identity is known. Message received, Morgan commands, surrounds and annihilates the guerrillas.",
