  "Plot": "One person rows the rowboat in the middle distance, while two people sit at either end. A man walks by with a lunchbox.The credits say this is the Kaiser and the .... Kaserin? The Empress of Germany I guess you would say, although which is which among these four people, I cannot say. I've described this 14-second short, and that's all there is. Really.Early movies are full of stuff like this: short films in which we are supposed to know who these people are. People knew who the Kaiser was back in 1895, or pretended to, but if they substituted some other guy in the rowboat, who would know? A dozen years later, Melies would release movies showing the coronation of the King of England a week before it happened, and no one said boo.",
