Neglecting to dispose of the contents of the bowl, same finds its way into the baker's bread, and the result almost proves the undoing of Lo-Hi. John Dough gives his assistance in the celebration of the Fourth. No end of trouble results from the invasion of his peaceful rest by the much-despised Miffkits. Then comes the cherub, who introduces Dough to his animal friends, incidentally secures supplies. He then visits the fairies' garden and later interviews the Princess Ozma, who makes a prophecy: \"The throne of Lo-Hi shall vacant be until the coming by air or sea of an oven baked man and a Cherub wee.\" Accordingly John Dough drops into the Land of Oz and meets the Cherub.",
