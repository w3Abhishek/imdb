Playing with his kind the child, who inherits his mother's Indian character, passes on to boyhood. Then the racial difference between the father and son is felt. At length the father, angered at the reluctance of the youth to leave his people and accompany him on a trading trip, compels the boy to do so by threats and violence, but later during the journey he becomes ashamed of his Indian wife and child. Broken guns and bad whiskey, sold to the Indians by the trader, inflame their desire for vengeance. In the coming attack the war-cry of his ancestors stirs the young Indian's blood. The father's crimes prove his own destruction, while the boy and his mother are claimed by their own.",
