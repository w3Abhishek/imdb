  "Plot": "George is addicted to the smoking habit, in fact he might be termed a \"Tobacco Fiend.\" To Alice, his wife, the fumes of tobacco smoke are extremely odious, and after a deal of persuasion he yields to her plea, swearing never to smoke the weed again. At first it seems possible, but later there comes such an insatiable craving he can stand it no longer, so he rents a quiet place where he goes and smokes in peace. All goes well, until his better half notices the regularity of his little walks, ostensibly for exercise, and she grows suspicious of she knows not what. However, she is determined to satisfy herself as to whether or not her hubby tells the truth. Quite the little surprise is in store for both man and wife.",
