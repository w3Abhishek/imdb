Cody) himself, mounted on his famous white steed said to be the most beautiful equine ever seen in public. It may be of interest to our patrons to know the fact that every horse in this parade, with one exception, was killed shortly afterwards in a disastrous railway wreck. The parade is varied in character, showing mounted Indians, Cowboys, Arabs, English troopers, Boer cavalry and our own famous Rough Riders, the rear being brought up by the mounted Cowboy Band.",
