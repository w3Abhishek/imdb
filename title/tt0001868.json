  "Plot": "This Bible story lends itself beautifully to cinematographic representation. The story of the great love of Abraham for his son Isaac, the command of Jehovah to sacrifice his son, Abraham's compliance with God's order and the angel's intervention at the last moment to prevent the actual sacrifice, is all beautifully shown in this highly interesting film. The subject is treated with the dignity it deserves and will impress this portion of Biblical history on the mind of both young and old in an entirely novel and lasting manner.",
