  "Plot": "The story is taken from one of the incidents in the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, the famous little fighting general. It is a matter of history that Napoleon was a stickler for discipline and any infringements of his orders met with summary punishment. A soldier doing picket duty on an outpost is visited by his sweetheart. He is nearly exhausted from his long vigil and loss of sleep. The meeting is an affectionate one and the girl offers to bring him food and drink, and steals away. The soldier lies down at the base of a haystack and is soon sound asleep. Napoleon has an attack of insomnia and is walking about inspecting the sentries. He approaches the post vacated by the soldier and is surprised to see his rifle lying on the ground. Napoleon is angry and is about to prod the sleeper with his sword when he takes compassion on him, shoulders the musket and paces the beat, wearing the shako of the recalcitrant sentinel. The girl returns with the food and, not recognizing the great commander, fondles him, thinking it is her lover. Napoleon prevents recognition for a time, but finally reveals his identity. The soldier awakes with a start, rises and is paralyzed with fear. He is granted clemency on account of the circumstances and Napoleon walks away, leaving the lovers happy.",
