  "Plot": "There are two young people of wealth and social position, the girl with an unselfish love for the unhelped little ones of the city and the young man intent upon his own enjoyment of life in his own circle. There are scenes showing her work and its effect upon the little ones and also the contrasting lives of the children who have no kindergarten and who must play in a crowded tenement room or in the middle of the street. One little lame child follows the girl into the kindergarten, but, as is the case in all of our big cities, the class is overcrowded, the teachers cannot take care of more and they are obliged to send the little chap away. He meets with an accident in the street and the young millionaire is thus made to realize the value of the work of the girl he loves. In the last scene the young man makes good by presenting the convalescent little boy with a sizable check for the kindergarten cause, thereby winning the apologies and the love of the girl.",
