Meanwhile the barber is wild, and the limit of his tolerance comes when she starts out on a joy ride with the favored one. Leaping on behind the car, he in jealous frenzy climbs in and throws his hated rival out over the back, takes his place beside the fair charmer, begging her to take the ring he proffers, which she does in reward of his valor.",
