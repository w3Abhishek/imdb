The little girl has set her heart on a pretty doll displayed in the toy shop window and dally worships at its shrine. Mrs. Smith would gladly buy it for Ida if she could but it is far beyond her means. Mrs. Jones, her employer, surmising the child's desire, buys the doll and sends it to Ida's house on Christmas Eve, unknown to the child. Ida finds a well-filled purse on the street dropped by a passerby. It is a temptation to her to keep it and buy the doll, but she runs after the loser and returns it to him. He rewards her very generously. She is anxious to purchase the doll, but knowing the need of the money at home, she carries it to her mother. The next day, Christmas, a well-filled tree, through the kindness of Mrs. Jones, is laden with good cheer for the Smiths and among the many presents is Ida's much-desired doll.",
