  "Plot": "Fred Gearhart was in destitute circumstances. He had a baby girl and in his extremity he yielded to the request of John Foster, a wealthy man, to adopt the child. Eighteen years later Florence is a charming young lady, and very much in love with Harry Jordan. Her wealthy foster father suddenly met with deep reverses. He saw a way to recoup his lost fortunes if Florence would marry a certain wealthy suitor, Howard Lacey. Her own father, longing to see his daughter again secured a position in the Foster household as butler. He overheard Foster asking Flo to marry Lacey and he saw her broken-hearted consenting. Then father love asserted itself. He told them who he was and sternly forbade the marriage. But Foster showed that he had the papers of adoption and that therefore Florence must bide by his wishes. Gearhart left the house in despair, although his daughter had plainly shown her love for her real father. But the loveless marriage was not to take place. Fortunate circumstances prevented it, and in the end Florence married Harry Jordan, and the two fathers were brought together in a firm bond of friendship.",
