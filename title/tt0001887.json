He espies a dude about to engage in the pastime of roller skating on the pavement. The convict is desperate, also resourceful, and in a jiffy he has appropriated the skates and swapped costumes with the lady-like young man. Once on the skates the criminal show familiarity with the footgear by gliding rapidly away. The alarm is given and the escaped prisoner is chased, and chased closely. He has many mishaps, throwing his pursuers off the trail and eluding them by skillful maneuvers and piling them up on the walk and in the street. Hotly pressed, he skates off a dock into the water and the chasers, unable to check their momentum, take impromptu baths, the scene producing material for screams of laughter. The dude is captured and locked up only to be released when the convict is finally captured and restored to his cell.",
