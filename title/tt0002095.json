The tribe has just departed for their village when a mountain outlaw appears and succeeds in stealing the blanket, having given the sentinel doctored whiskey. When the Indians discover this they exile the unfaithful sentinel until he can recover the blanket. About this time there comes to the mountains a little family, which is forced into the location on account of the ill health of the old father. They meet the outlaw, who is stricken ill, and dying, he presents the sacred blanket to the wife. Later on, the blanket is seen in her possession by the exiled Indian and he vows to recover it. In his attempt he yields his life, but the blanket is retained to the tribe through his sacrifice.",
