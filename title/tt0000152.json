  "Plot": "Numbered 95 in the catalogues of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' Star Film Company, \"L'hallucination de l'alchimiste (1897)\" is often misidentified as Alchimiste Parafaragaramus ou La cornue infernale (1906), and vice versa, where another alchemist dabbles in the occult with unforeseen consequences. Sadly, this film is currently presumed lost; however, according to Wikipedia, the plot pivots around an anthropomorphous star with five female heads and a giant face that has people coming out of its mouth.",
