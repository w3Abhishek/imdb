Broken-hearted, she goes to America, where she gets into bad company. She shoots a man who wants to blackmail her son, now a rising man. She is tried for murder, and refuses to give any information regarding herself to the judge, as she is afraid it might get to her son's ears. Great is her horror when she finds that the man who is to defend her at the trial is her own son. She also recognizes her husband, who has come to the court to see his son conduct the case. The young barrister, without knowing that it is his own mother he is defending, pleads for her so well that she is acquitted. The husband relents, as his wife is dying, and tells his son that he has been defending his own mother, who dies in the arms of her long-lost son.",
