Both of these Irish ladies are splendid cooks, but the boys at Snakeville, including \"Alkali Ike\" and \"Mustang Pete,\" seem to favor Mrs. Riley, who gets all the tread. So Mrs. Dugan goes to the city to look for a pretty girl, who can draw trade. Lizzie Ryan appeals to her, so she takes her back. Just as everybody is going out to lunch, Mrs. Dugan tells Lizzie that she must walk the main street to see if she can bring boarders to her house. Everybody comes to her, including \"Mustang Pete,\" who tells Lizzie that he loves her. He is rejected. Designing to make himself appear a hero in Lizzie's eyes, he induces \"Alkali\" to fight a duel, in which he is supposed to be killed, but when Mrs. Riley enters, and on seeing the outstretched form of her lover on the ground, she turns to \"Alkali\" and takes him to her heart. Of course, this is a big surprise to the boys, as none supposed that \"Alkali\" was the favored suitor, and the episode ends in \"Mustang Pete\" finally relinquishing his cling and congratulating the couple.",
