In more ways than one Buck is shown kindness by the sheriff, who urges him to serve his time. A few years later, when Buck is released, he reads that there is a reward for the capture of one Dare Devil Kelly, hiding in Snake Canon. The sheriff is incapacitated through injury to his ankle and after vainly calling for volunteers to go after the bad man, the sheriff gives Buck the chance. Buck, after a hot fight with the outlaw and his wife, captures Kelly, though he has suffered some at the hands of Mrs. Kelly, a real Amazon. Later, Buck, who is in sympathy with Kelly's wife, mails her the reward money he has received, with the hope that it will tide her over until her husband is released.",
