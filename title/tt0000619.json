  "Plot": "Hunting scenes have ever been a leading feature in motion pictures since their inception, and the Biograph here presents a most thrilling series, a Caribou Hunt in the Barrens of Newfoundland. It starts with a scene showing the hunting party leaving Portland, Me., by train. They arrive at Millertown, N.F, where they are met by the guides, and from here the journey is made in canoes. Next is shown real camp life in the wilderness. The hunters start out in pursuit of the fleet-footed game, of which many are seen at remarkably close range. Several caribou are shot and taken in the course of the hunt. The excitement reaches a climax when one of the animals is run to the beach, and as he stands sniffing the air, a well-directed shot takes effect. Leaping forward, he plunges into the water, but a second shot follows and the magnificent caribou becomes the sportsman's trophy. This film is unquestionably an interesting hunting picture.",
