  "Plot": "Jim Smith kept a grocery store and business got so quiet that his hardest work was to keep his clerks awake. He at length decided to sell out and inserted an advertisement in the paper to that effect. Well Old Hiram Greengage sees the \"ad\" and calls on Smith at his residence and promises to look the store over. Jim gets busy and gathering his friends together gives each a dollar note with which to come to the store and make purchases while Hiram is there. Well, you would think a cyclone had struck the place. Mobs of customers are clamoring to be waited on and the efforts of Jim and the clerks are taxed to the limit. Things certainly do look rosy for Jim, when Hiram leaves apparently satisfied saying he will let him know in an hour. Later Jim receives a note: \"Dear Mr. Smith: Your store has all the business you claim, but I am too old to take charge of such a rushing business. Yours. Hiram Greengage.\" Now wouldn't it jar you?",
