Lewis then slinks out of the saloon and encounters Jake Webster, with whom he also has a quarrel. Guns are drawn and the result is the death of Lewis, when Webster accidentally discharges his weapon. Harley later comes on the scene and at first thinking that Lewis is in a drunken sleep kicks his feet, laughing, and then discovers that Lewis is dead. Harley is crouching beside the body of Lewis, with the gun in his hand when the sheriff arrives and arrests him, charging him with the murder. Harley is locked up and the real criminal, Webster, rides hurriedly away. Arriving at the Harley ranch, he applies for a position here and is given work. A few days later, when old man Harley is worrying about his son, a newspaper is handed him announcing the finding of the jury in his son's trial. Harley has been found guilty and has been sentenced to be hung at sundown. Webster finds the paper, and after struggling with his conscience resolves to ride to the county seat and save young Harley's life. He arrives at the jail just in the nick of time, confesses, and young Harley is granted his freedom.",
