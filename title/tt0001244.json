  "Plot": "The trouble began owing to Mr. Gayman's infatuation for a vaudeville star, who, in the due course of events, presented him with a photograph of herself in a part that required her to wear a dress that began low above and finished high below. What was more natural than that Mrs. Gayman, in the course of her wifely duties of going through his pockets, should discover it and throw it out of the window and substitute the photo of a demure salvation lass? How could the theme of this film be accomplished if little Willie and his big brother playing leapfrog outside had not found it and naturally took it home with them, where their papa quickly confiscated it? To describe the various adventures of this fascinating photo in detail would spoil the fun that even the most hardened exhibitor is sure to get out of the picture. But we will tell you that in the course of the story the photo passed through the hands of four men, two boys, one idiot, a negress, a clergyman and two policemen, and is discovered and thrown away by three wives and one fianc\u00e9e. It eventually fell into the hands of a Bronx policeman. He, of course, being an honest man, took it to the station house, where the original soon appeared to explain it. But the desk sergeant was the happiest man, for he was the one who kept it for all time nailed above his desk.",
