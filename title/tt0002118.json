  "Plot": "Frank Fuller, a cowboy, is in love with Tessie, the daughter of John W. Scadds, newly from the east. He has declared his love and is accepted, but to ask Mr. and Mrs. Scadds for her hand is a task which he very much dreads. He at last musters up courage enough to ask her mother whom he finds most sympathetic and agreeable, but her father proves to be the stumbling block. He strongly disapproves and sternly rejects Fuller's suit, and later on refuses to recognize him at all. This, however, does not prevent the young people from meeting frequently and planning how best to bring about their union without resorting to the usual elopement in such cases. At last they hit an idea and decide to put it into execution at once. The scheme is to let an unknown cowboy sell or trade one of Fuller's horses to old Scadds and then Fuller's cowboys are to scour the country for the supposed stolen horse, and when they find Scadds in possession of it, accuse him of horse stealing and proceed to hang him to the nearest tree. At the psychological moment Fuller is to arrive and pretend to save Scadds from an awful fate. The plan works out and Scadds no longer objects to Fuller as a son-in-law, but welcomes his heroic rescuer into his hitherto impenetrable family circle.",
