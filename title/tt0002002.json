While the sweethearts are oblivious to occurrences about them, the Alcalde and his sister stop at the shop and ask for a drink of water. It is very apparent the Alcalde is much attracted to Melitta's charms, but in her eyes there is no one like Basilio. The Alcalde sends a note to Melitta, saying his sister is sick, and wants Melitta to come to her. Arriving at the house, Melitta finds she has been tricked. Grasping a sword she repulses the Alcalde's advances and effects her escape. A month later, to revenge himself on Melitta, the Alcalde schemes to connect Basilio with a pair of revolutionists, and is partially successful. The next day the Alcalde's plot is discovered and threatened with exposure. He obeys his sister's and the Padre's orders, confesses his guilt and apologizes to Basilio and Melitta.",
