  "Plot": "Clarence McKnight and Felix De Grosse are rivals for the heart of pretty little Letitia Mooney, but it is evident that Clarence is the favored one. However, Letty becomes jealous of her cousin, who seems to have a feeling down in her heart for Clarence, and engages his attention whenever she gets the chance. Letty determines to pay him for this fancied wrong by going boating with Felix. As an oarsman Felix is a bit weak, and colliding with another boat, tumbles over, carrying the oars with him. This leaves Letty in the oarless boat at the mercy of the tide. Clarence, who has followed, appears in another boat and rescues the fair one from her perilous position by taking her aboard his own boat, rowing her down the stream, while they settle their little misunderstanding. This effected, they come back to find Felix still diving after the lost Letty, who, he imagines, is at the bottom of the lake, feeling sure she went overboard when he did. So you see the reward received by Felix for being an accomplice in Letty's pique was a serious ducking and almost a flogging, for his terror has caused others to jump overboard to the rescue of the missing girl.",
