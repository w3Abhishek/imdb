Left alone, she goes out to amuse herself, and as several children pass on their way to school, she wants to accompany them. They playfully tell her she has no books. An idea! She goes into the house and gathers up an armful of books out of the bookcase, and off she starts by her \"lonely.\" During this time mamma has been packing up her trunk to leave the place, and has ordered the expressman to call. In readiness to go, she looks for the child, and the only clue leading to her whereabouts is the finding of a book on the front lawn. The expressman remembers passing, in fact almost running over, a little tot with her arms full of books. The dropping of these books leads the mother on, accompanied by the expressman, until they find her in the hands of a couple of tramps. How she gets there is impossible to describe in a short space. You may be assured that by this time the parents' quarrel has been forgotten.",
