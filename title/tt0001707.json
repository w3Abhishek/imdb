Belle, being quick-witted, evades them all by promising each one an answer the following day at a given hour. The summer house in her garden is the rendezvous. The suitors arrive one by one, each under the impression that he is \"It\" and the others intruders. When Belle appears upon the scene an argument ensues which develops into a small riot, whereupon she turns the garden hose on the turmoiled crowd, which rapidly disperses. The would-be lovers' activity causes Belle to laugh so hysterically that she accidentally turns the hose on herself.",
