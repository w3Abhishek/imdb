They arrive at the dock, only to see the ferry sail away. Mr. Gayton now suggests that they go to an inn for dinner. They arrive only to find that it is in flames. They encounter many more amusing incidents, and before they are finally inside of their house, Gayton finds that he had left the key inside. As he is climbing through the window he is caught by a cop, who is about to arrest him, and is only saved from humiliation by Mrs. Gayton, who explains things.",
