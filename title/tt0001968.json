  "Plot": "The young businessman becomes so engrossed with the building up of his new business, that he, to a degree, neglects his wife and little child. Of course, like all enthusiastic businessmen, he does not realize that his wife tires of the everlasting harangue of business. It is \"business, business, always business.\" Hence it is small wonder that the wife listens to the poisonous flattery of the husband's college mate, whom he introduces to her. This false friend tries to strengthen his sinister purpose by arousing the suspicion of the wife against her husband by placing a photograph of his stenographer in his coat pocket, which is found later by the wife. This is apparently most convincing, and the wife consents to go away with this wretch. The maid overhears their plans and informs the husband, who would wreak vengeance, but the child's cry of \"Mamma, Mamma\" averts a tragedy of a soul and body.",
