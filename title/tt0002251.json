  "Plot": "Hoffmeyer is harassed by creditors, but thinks his troubles are over when he receives a legacy of $500. He sneaks away from his wife to make a \"flash\" around town, and comes home at 2 A.M., feeling happy. His joy is short-lived, however, when he finds the door locked, and his spouse on the other side demands the money before she will permit him to enter. He takes half of it and hides it under a barrel, and his wife, peeping behind the curtain, sees him. After he has retired she goes out to get the rest of the money, and Hoffmeyer locks the door and refuses to let her in until she sends in the money. Clad in her nightgown, she is being thoroughly chilled, when she sees men approaching and runs away. Frightened, Hoffmeyer, clad in his pajamas, goes out to bring her back. The chase is joined in by neighbors and police, presenting ludicrous situations, until Hoffmeyer catches up with his spouse and is arrested with her. The police magistrate in the night court suffers an injury to his dignity when the struggling pair are brought before him, but he quickly counts the money taken from them and fines them $500.",
