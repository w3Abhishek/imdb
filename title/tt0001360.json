However, Blackburn would not be put off in this way, so he endeavored to do away with Sadie, but, unknown to him, she was rescued by the Salvation Army and grew into womanhood under their care. While engaged in her charitable work in New York, she was saved from insult by Carroll Graves, who, although he led a Bohemian life, was good at heart. He knew Blackburn from out west and had been robbed of a fortune by him through false gambling. He has in his possession legal papers to the effect that Sadie was among the living, and he was now in search of her and Blackburn. Graves recognized Sadie and, having also located Blackburn, he wrote to him to call at his home, but through cunning Blackburn drugs him and robs him of the papers and kills O'Gall, a friend of Graves, who had come to his rescue. In the scuffle the candle is upset and the house commences to burn, but Sadie saves Graves from an untimely death. A few years elapse, during which Sadie becomes a great singer, and Blackburn, not knowing who she really is, becomes infatuated with her. On Graves' wish, she makes an appointment with Blackburn, where he is met by Graves and a detective. On presentation of the serious charge against him, he suddenly puts an end to his wretched life.",
