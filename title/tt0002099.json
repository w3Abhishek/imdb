On the reverse side of the card is a message to Jack from some chorus girl, asking Jack to meet her at the chorus girls' ball. The doctor's wife, while sewing a button on the doctor's coat, finds the card and thinks it is meant for her husband. She determines to disguise herself as a chorus girl and meet her husband herself. This she does, but on her way to the ball her auto runs into a post and she is rendered unconscious. Jack sees the accident and he carries her into his house. She revives and he induces her to take a few drinks. Meanwhile Jack telephones his friend the doctor to call at once, believing her seriously injured. When the doctor calls he finds his supposed patient doing a bear dance with Jack. He recognizes his wife in the chorus girl, and proceeds to give Jack a very artistic beating. His wife, having gone home, awaits his return, showing him the card as the reason for her actions. He shows her the reverse side of the card, with Jack's I.O.U., and serious complications are thus averted.",
