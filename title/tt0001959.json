  "Plot": "Two young people, plighted lovers for many years past, play a joke on their fathers, who are old linguists, by writing a letter in a reverse hand. One old man claims it to be archaic Greek, while the other says it to be old Hebrew. A quarrel ensues which terminates by both vowing that his child shall not marry the other's. The young people are forbidden to call upon one another, so they resort to the phonograph. The young man dictates a message into the machine, telling his fianc\u00e9e to elope with him. He has the record delivered with all possible speed. At the proper time they meet at their trysting place. Both fathers start in pursuit in automobiles only to reach the river to see their children far away. The old men take another boat, which capsizes, giving the two a good ducking. The lovers come to their fathers' aid, and everything is explained.",
