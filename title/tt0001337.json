  "Plot": "Dick Harcourt and Dora Dean are both cruelly jilted by their sweethearts. Each of them vows never to marry. Dick even goes so far as to join the Anti-marriage Club. But the sub-title of this film is \"A Comedy Of Errors Corrected By Cupid\"; and now that mischievous lad goes to work. Dick and Dora (strangers, mind you) are traveling on the same train; and by accident(?) they sit together. Now Dick, on his way to the train station, had gotten some grains of rice stuck to his clothing by accident(?). Also, by accident(?) a member or Dick's Anti-Marriage Club is riding on the same train. He sees the \"couple\", sees the rice, and puts one and one together to get two married people. He wires ahead to the Club members that Dick is a traitor. When the train arrives the Club members have arranged a mock reception party for Dick and Dora. But many of the good citizens of the town take the thing seriously, and soon Dora has a pile of wedding gifts. Well, a couple of well placed darts later, Dick and Dora decide not to return those gifts; and, to quote the Biograph Bulletin, \"Cupid lands a knockout.\"",
