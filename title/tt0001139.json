Anyone who's a fan of the Old West knows of Buffalo Bill; his adventures, as recounted in dime novels by Ned Buntline, form the basis of our mythic view of that era.Gordon William Lille, sometimes known as \"The Little Giant From Oklahoma\" hailed from Indiana, although by the age of 19 he was an Indian agent in what is today Oklahoma. In 1883, he worked as a Pawnee interpreter for the Buffalo Bill show. He and his wife formed their first show in 1888, then combined their show with Bill's some time in the late 1900s. He died in 1942, aged 81.",
