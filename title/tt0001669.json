  "Plot": "John Grey was a middle-aged businessman with a young and beautiful wife. One morning he left home without some valuable papers which he needed. His wife brought them to the office, which she was surprised to find in a very disorderly condition, according to her mind. Her husband's birthday was close at hand, and she conceived the idea of refurnishing his office, as a surprise. To this end, she enlisted the services of Grey's young clerk. Grey saw them together, and imagined that the clerk and his wife were in love. He said nothing, however. A few days later, his wife was at the office planning for her husband's surprise, when Grey arrived. The clerk hid her behind the screen, and while Grey's back was turned, helped her to escape through the door. Grey had seen his wife, though he did not let it be known, and he was cast into the depths of despair at the thought that she whom he loved with his whole heart was untrue to him. He thought of going away after leaving her all his property in order that she might marry the man of her choice. He was in this exalted and at the same time despondent mood when he arrived at his office one day, and found it all refurnished, with his wife standing in the midst of it, smiling at him and more beautiful than ever. Then he understood the reason for all the meetings between her and his clerk, and he realized on what a false foundation he had built all his suspicions.",
