  "Plot": "Homely as this might seem, it is the moving factor of this Biograph romance. Harry and Claire had long loved each other, but, while Harry was a good sort, Papa had made other plans for Claire. He had arranged to give her hand in marriage to a wealthy old fossil, of whom he knew little but the extent of his pecuniary assets. The day for his arrival was at hand and Harry and Claire determined to make one last appeal. They do, and with usual result. Dejected they leave the room, when a one-legged hobo attracts Harry's attention. An idea! He calls in the tramp and suggests Claire put on the wooden leg, the tramp to hide in the closet. Well the ancient swain appears and presses his suit, which is received with nonchalance by Claire, but when he sees the tip of the wooden leg protruding from beneath the flounce of her skirt he turns and \"beats it\" with such dispatch that he knocks Papa over when he tries to detain him. The tramp is given a V for his part of the game, and we leave Harry and Claire happy in each other's arms.",
