Despite his efforts to cure himself of his terrible habit, temptation is always stronger than his will, and Agnes, his daughter, is in despair. Finally persuaded to take treatment at a sanitarium by Rev. Small, Carter decides to give it a trial. He returns in the fall, cured. A month later, Carter is passing Jake Easton's saloon, when two or three of his former cronies invite him to have a drink. He refuses, and the boys, under Easton's orders, drag him into the saloon and force him to drink. The old craving returns and Carter returns home that night again intoxicated. The next morning he determines to have revenge against Easton, seeks him out and in a fight he accidentally kills Easton with the latter's own weapon. Returning to his cabin, Carter tells his daughter and Reverend Small what he has done, and Small, desiring to make it appear that Easton has been shot in self-defense, slightly wounds the forester and when the trial comes up later, Carter is discharged.",
