  "Plot": "Another success for the Great Northern Film Company. The photography is excellent and the acting perfect. The subject is perhaps a little strong, but if the spectators do not fancy the different love affairs of Hercules, they are well repaid by the splendid execution of the work. The manufacturers are always most careful in their details, and in this film they do not show us a skeleton for the Hercules, but a fine specimen of physical culture, and they so cleverly distribute the lights as to bring out the forms and muscles of the man. Such films with so easy and natural actions can never tire an audience, but, on the contrary, are pleasing and always well received. It is no more a question of pushing a few inexperienced men in front of a camera, but it is real art. -- The Moving Picture World, December 26, 1908",
