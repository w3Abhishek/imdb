She enlists the aid of Pedro, a Mexican lover, and craftily promises to marry him if he will carry out her scheme. Pedro agrees and she sends him to Olive, then gets Simpson. Pedro is repulsed by Olive, but persistently takes her in his arms just as Dolores and Simpson, in the distance, look on. Simpson believes Olive false and is heartbroken. Pedro now goes to Dolores, but she laughs at him and refuses to keep her promise of marriage. He strikes her and flees. She furiously sends some Mexican vaqueros in pursuit to catch and hang him. Pedro takes refuge in Olive's cabin and begs her to save him, promising to confess Dolores' plot. Olive hurries to Simpson and begs him to save Pedro. At first he sternly refuses, but she points to his star and he returns with her, rescues Pedro from the vaqueros and then listens to his confession. Pedro is allowed to go, then Simpson begs Olive's forgiveness for having doubted her, gains it and they are happy once more.",
