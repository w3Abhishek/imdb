  "Plot": "Happy Hooligan (1900) An organ grinder is playing below the window of a woman who wants him to move. He refuses and she goes to do something but while gone another man convinces him to move. The woman then reappears with a bucket of water and throws it not realizing that a cop is now standing there. HAPPY HOOLIGAN is a decent film for the period, although there's nothing shocking, ground-breaking or even all that interesting here. That's not the say the film isn't worth watching as there's a nice stage set as well as a couple small laughs. Fans of the early cinema will want to check this out at least once.",
