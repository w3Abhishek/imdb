The son has gained the enmity of an ugly-tempered Mexican who works on the ranch and who has sworn to get even. His chance comes when the son is entrusted with a large sum of money and sent to town, the Mexican accompanying him. On the way the Mexican works the boy's disgrace by inducing him to gamble at the road house, where he loses the money entrusted to him. The father, upon learning this, casts the boy out. The Mexican takes advantage of this by assaulting the father and robbing him, reasoning that the son will be accused of the deed on account of the trouble which he has had with his father. All this seems to work out well, until fate turns the tables on the Mexican. The incident proves a powerful lesson to the boy.",
