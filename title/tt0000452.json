To find out if the girl really loves him, he sends a note with the messenger boy requesting her to \"wear this\" if she does. The boy delivers the note and a package which the young lady opens and finds an old pair of trousers and other masculine wearing apparel. She becomes enraged. When \"Cholly\" comes she proceeds to give him instructions as to what to do in the future, etc., but before she finishes, the boy, having discovered his mistake, returns with the right box. \"Cholly\" hastily closes up the wrong one, hands it to the boy and kicks him out of the door. He then opens the right box and presents the bouquet himself. She wears the flowers, and things are now all right.",
