But soon jealousy creeps in and Cain becomes envious of the love so showered upon Abel by his father and mother. Finally the two sons make their offerings to God, and Cain's offering is displeasing in the sight of God, while Abel's is acceptable. This so enrages Cain that he commits the terrible crime with which we are all so familiar. The remaining scenes of the film show the tortures of remorse.",
