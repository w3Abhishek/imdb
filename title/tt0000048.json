  "Plot": "The Boxing Kangaroo (1895)This film has become rather popular over the years because of what the title promises the viewer and it actually delivers. For around twenty-five seconds a man and a kangaroo box. Yes, that's all that happens but as long as you don't take it too serious then you're bound to have a little fun with it. The film's condition is in poor shape but that doesn't take away from the fun as the kangaroo seems to be getting a good work out at the very least. I'm sure PETA members might object to this but at the same time I'm sure this was a staged act back in the day.",
