It commands us to look neither to the right nor to the left, but straight forward. These were the noble principles instilled in the makeup of Jack Allen, the policeman. Jack, his younger brother Bob and their mother comprised the little family. To-day is Bob's twenty-first birthday and mother and Jack make him a present of a cap, with his initials \"B.A.\" on the lining. Jack goes out on his beat and Bob leaves the house seemingly highly pleased with his present. During the evening Jack is called to the scene of the robbery of a jewelry store. While going over the place for a possible clue, he finds a cap, on the inside of which there are the telltale, letters \"B.A.\" Crushed beyond measure he seeks Bob out at their home and it is all too true. Bob is inclined to brave the situation, and the poor old mother's heart is breaking, but Jack's duty is plain. Bob is carried to prison.",
