He hastens to Army to inform her of his prospects, and takes leave of her in her rose garden. Hugh goes to the city, and mingles with the fast set. Amy sends him a pair of slippers that she has embroidered with his initials. He receives them just as he is entertaining his blas\u00e9 friends. The package is opened, but tossed aside. In the meantime, Amy visits the post office every day, awaiting news from her sweetheart. At school she reads the engagement of Hugh to a wealthy city woman. The shock is too much for her; it turns her brain. AT a dinner, surrounded by his companions, a street singer appears and sings, \"With the Last Rose of Summer, I'll Come Back to You.\" Hugh listens. In an instant it all comes back to him. He rushes out of the place, and denounces the woman to whom he is engaged. He journeys to his home town, but is ostracized. At her mother's home, she points to the rose garden. He finds her there in a demented state. He sings their favorite song, \"With the Last Rose of Summer, I'll Come Back to You.\" She listens; her reason gradually returns, and is clasped in his arms.",
