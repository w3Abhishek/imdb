Lillian's father, however, does not take kindly to Jack, and enters strenuous objections when Jack asks him for Lillian's hand. Jack is not disconcerted. Pursuing his suit, the lovers agree to elope. Mounting Jack's hand-car they start for a run to the adjoining town where they propose to get married. Lillian's father, however, quickly discovers their plans, mounts his engine, and starts in pursuit. As he is about to overtake the elopers, a landslide sends a lot of dirt, stumps and trees across the track, causing the engine to stop, and permitting the fleeing pair to finally reach their destination, where they are quickly married. Returning home, explanations take place, and a reconciliation is affected.",
