  "Plot": "One night all the boys of the Seven Up Ranch are invited to the house to meet Bud Simpson's niece from Lizardhead. After hours of brushing up his dusty best clothes, Alkali Ike finally rigs himself out and, with a freshly washed rubber collar roped about his neck, chases into the ranch house where he finds the lovely Sophie seated at the organ, surrounded by the boys, who are industriously screeching their heads off in an endeavor to sing. Alkali Ike vainly attempts to elbow his way through and get a sight of the fair Sophie, but in vain, and is finally thrown out of the house by the boys. But his wooing is not in vain, and the next morning a motorcyclist arrives at the ranch and stops for a while. Alkali immediately sees possibilities in the machine, buys it outright, and invites Sophie to take a spin with him along the trail. She delightedly agrees, and then the fun begins. Of course Alkali loses control of the mechanism and the wildest of rides ensues. Finally the machine lands in the creek and there we leave Alkali in the hands of the enraged Sophie, who does things good and plenty to him.",
