This attracts the envious attention of Native American low-lives, who follow him outside, knife him, and flee with his money. In the nick of time, a Native American woman arrives on the scene who nurses the gravely wounded man back to health. They marry, have a son, and live blissfully for a few years. Then the man learns that his father has died, leaving him an estate. Realizing that he cannot introduce his wife into polite society back East, he vows to renounce his inheritance. The wife solves his problem by putting a bullet in her head.",
