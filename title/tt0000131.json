However, much to his surprise, an enormous eight-legged adversary in the form of a frightful hairy spider crawls up on the foot of his bed, thwarting the man's plans for a good sleep. Suddenly, the broom next to him becomes the weapon of choice, but it seems that the persistent foe has already won. Who could sleep after such a fierce battle?",
