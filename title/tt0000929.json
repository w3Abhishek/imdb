  "Plot": "This one is a very early kiddie comedy as some scamps get their hands on a pot of very strong glue and proceed to wreak havoc.Except for the mischief makers being children, this is fairly standard for the era, a time in which adults with glue tormenting anyone who turned his back was considered good sport in the movies. Although the pranksters being children makes it nominally more likely, there is no advantage taken of this conceit, and the result is a standard comedy for the era. It differs from earlier efforts by the likes of Alice Guy or Georges Melies only in the number of cuts.The version I saw, posted on Youtube by the inestimable Notremaxnational, lacks the punctuation of a chase sequence, but its abrupt ending indicates that it was there in the original version.",
