  "Plot": "This is the old story which has been handed down to us from time immemorial, and which was woven into a drama by Goethe and set to music by Gounod. The story of Faust and his temptation by the devil is so well known as to render a repetition of the story unnecessary. The film follows closely the Goethe dramatization, and is magnificent in its scenery, action and coloring. Like Il Trovatore, the music has been arranged to suit the film, scene for scene, and, with the musical accompaniment, forms a spectacle unequaled in the world of motion pictures. Faust is shown in his study, tired of life. Mephistopheles tempts him, shows him Marguerite, and offers to restore Faust's youth if he will sign away his soul. Other scenes show Faust at the Kirmess; show him changed to a youth again; show his love-making to Marguerite, his duel with her brother; Marguerite's final arrest, the loss of reason and death, and finally Mephistopheles claiming her soul. Undoubtedly this film will make a tremendous impression, and be thoroughly enjoyed by everyone who witnesses it. - The Moving Picture World, June 17, 1911",
