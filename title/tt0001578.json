  "Plot": "Jim Lee, an old prospector, after some years working a rather meager claim in the desert, strikes a great vein of gold. Staking his claim, Jim takes specimens of the ore to town and shows them to various of his friends at Bud Riley's saloon. Two new prospectors plot to get the claim and after getting Jim drunk they learn of the location of the mine. The next day Jim returns to the claim and becomes suspicious when he sees the two prospectors loitering near. That night he wads up his blankets to make it appear he is in bed and waits outside. One of the prospectors soon comes on the scene and fires into the tent at what he supposes is Lee. Lee overpowers the two men and tying them together turns them loose in the desert. They are nearly dead with thirst when Lee relents and turning them loose orders them out of the country.",
