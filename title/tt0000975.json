  "Plot": "Everything on this old mundane sphere has its use. Even the burglar's visit, strange as it may seem, may prove a blessing, as this Biograph comedy will verify. Jones has an insatiable longing to go to the club for a little game, so as a subterfuge tells his wife he is called away on business. Mrs. J. by this time has become cruelly incredulous and declares she will wait up for him. At the club Jonesy breaks the bank, things come his way, but when he leaves for home he anticipates that on his return things may continue to come, but not so felicitously. However, luck is still with him, for he finds a burglar trying to gain entrance into his home. Aha! an idea. The burglar is a coward, and he forces him to break in and so plays the hero, thereby softening his wife's anger by apparently apprehending him.",
