But the worst comes when he finds his work shut down, for the time being, at least. The mother and father are in deep despair when a letter arrives from the bachelor brother, as follows: \"My Dear Friends, As I grow old and lonely, I sometimes think I would like to have a child that would be like a son or daughter. You are always complaining that you have so many. Well, send one to me, and I will repay you with a fair sum of money. Your brother, Mark.\" Here is a splendid chance to lighten their burden, and so they make a round of the little cots on which the young ones are sleeping, with the view of selecting which one they will send. Well, the result is the following note: \"Dear Brother, Me and my wife have thought over your kind letter. At first we were going to send you all our children, but we find we are too poor to spare one. John \"",
