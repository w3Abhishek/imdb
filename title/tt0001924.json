  "Plot": "A gentleman thief has for a sweetheart and accomplice a maid, whose plan it is to get employment in a house and tip him off as to the lay of the land. While waiting for her in an adjoining park, he meets a pretty little girl and is deeply impressed by her innocence and candor. Her purity and honesty almost make him loathe himself. The night of the job arrives and the thief and his assistant wait outside for the maid's signal, which comes immediately, as she has seized a favorable opportunity, when all the folks are out. An entrance is effected, but a slight noise arouses the daughter, who is still at home. She tells the butler, who has just returned, her fears, and he manages to surprise the assistant, the real burglar being behind a screen. You may imagine the thief's amazement when he discovers that the daughter is the girl he met in the park. Through a clever move he manages to drive his assistant off and leave the house himself, in a better frame of mind. Upon reaching the park, where his sweetheart, the maid, is waiting, he tells her he is through with that life for good and intends to take the better road, which she is delighted to hear.",
