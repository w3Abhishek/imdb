Dissatisfied with his life, a desperate man decides to make an unholy pact with the Devil, trading his immortal soul for unlimited wealth, knowledge and earthly pleasures. All of a sudden, by the power of magic and the tricks of the archfiend, precious objects and beautiful artefacts start manifesting out of thin air, cramming the humble homestead's empty rooms. However, there is always a catch in such Faustian bargains: the descent to hell through the seven deadly sins is inevitable.",
