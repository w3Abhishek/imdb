  "Plot": "The young son of a wealthy Mexican house returns home from school. He is the only son of a widowed mother, whose heart beats only for him. He becomes fascinated by a pretty but low barmaid, who really returns his love, he being the first person she has truly loved. The mother finding the efforts to break his attachment for the girl futile, appeals to her, showing that by such an alliance the boy would lose his name, his high honor, trying to prove that if she really loved him she would give him up. The girl realizes the situation, and swears to do as the mother wishes, and so pretends a deception with an old-time suitor. It has its effect, for the young man goes away disgusted, but almost heartbroken. No sooner has he gone than she casts aside this lover with repulsion. This man sees that her heart is the young man's alone and goes after him with sinister mien. She, fearing for this lovers' mad jealousy, follows, and as he fires throws herself between the two, receiving the fatal shot. Her only recompense was her dying in his arms, he now knowing the extent of her love for him.",
