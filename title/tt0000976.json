  "Plot": "We are all cognizant of the fact that our friend Jones is of a jealous disposition, for the little episode at the rehearsal of the Amateur Dramatic Club is still fresh in our minds, but Jones in vindication claims there is no true love without jealousy. Well, here is another incident where the verdure-eyed makes its appearance. A lady friend of Emma calls and leaves a very pretty bouquet of roses, and when Eddie arrives he wants to know where they came from. Mrs. J., incensed at his insinuating question, refuses to enlighten him. Her actions seem convincing, which situation is intensified by the finding of a strange hat in the hallway. As furious as an Othello he rushes about the house, with a sword in hand, to annihilate the perfidious traducer of his home. Mrs. Jones is now alarmed and would have explained if she could, but she was unable to account for the hat or the owner, who is subsequently found. The maid, however, holds the key to the mystery. She had broken a handsome vase and secretly brought in this workman to repair it. Hence the tragedy did not occur.",
