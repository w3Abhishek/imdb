  "Plot": "There is nothing so calculated to excite risibility as the sight of a practical joker who is made the victim of his own plot. This sort of a climax is the big laugh in the \"Farmer's Daughter.\" The young lady in question is courted by all of the young lads about the countryside. Among them is a young chap, son of one of her neighbors, who becomes jealous of her other suitors and plans to prevent them from interfering with his love making. The approach to the farmer's home is a small stream over which is thrown a log for a foot path. The young chap takes it into his head to soap the log at a certain point so that those crossing after him will be plunged into the creek. All goes well and our young joker is having things pretty much his own way when his rivals one by one attempt to cross the log and are precipitated into the stream. It is impossible to describe the fun, but the witnessing of it is a series of laughs. Finally when our young friend, in high spirits at having outwitted his rivals, takes his leave of the farmer's daughter, he is so overjoyed that in crossing the log he forgets all about the soap, with dire results. His inamorata witnesses his downfall, and is seized with a fit of laughter.",
