He is bound and thrown on the floor. Editha's sympathies are aroused by the cruel treatment of the outlaw, and she succeeds in permitting him to escape without being suspected herself, and consequently wins de Villary's undying gratitude. Editha discovers that she will be forced to wed her father's choice, a nobleman sixty years of age. Her lover is sent for in order that he may aid her to escape this terrible marriage, but ere plans can be arranged for their future, they are discovered. A fight ensues and Editha at the risk of her life succeeds in getting her lover away, and in consequence the irate father vows she shall wed at once the first who passes his castle door, the nobleman having stated that she is no fit match for him. The first who passes by proves to be none other than the escaped outlaw, and a series of romantic incidents follows until at the close of the picture, we have the pleasure of seeing Editha wedded to the man of her choice.",
