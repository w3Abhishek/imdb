  "Plot": "A detective story by the Great Northern Film Co. is a masterly production in every respect. The plot in itself is interesting and well worked out. The staging is splendid and introduces some novel effects, not claptrap contraptions, but very realistic in all details. The action throughout is natural and spirited in some parts. There is a marked difference between the action in the Danish productions and those of other foreign makers. The Danes seem to do everything so seriously that at times their actions seem sluggish; at any rate it differs from the \"chic\" of the French actor. But it is none the worse for this; in fact, it is a pleasing variety, and if their succeeding productions of the \"Sherlock Holmes\" series equal the first, the series should prove a big success. -- The Moving Picture World, December 5, 1908",
