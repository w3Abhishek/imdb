  "Plot": "Perhaps the most attractive feature of this picture is the reproduction of early Roman costumes and Roman surroundings. It is a story of political intrigue, with all the contests and disagreeable features connected therewith in the ancient city. But the reproduction of manners and customs and the historically correct scenery and settings add immensely to the interest and insure attention when perhaps the mere political story would scarcely be considered. The greatest service the motion picture can do is in the direction of educating the people, and a film like this, which faithfully illustrates long past and perhaps partially forgotten life, is of vast importance and deserves a cordial reception. The Selig players have brought enthusiasm to their work and have put much ability and life into the interpretation of this play. - The Moving Picture World, February 26, 1910",
