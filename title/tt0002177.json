Hence there is a renewal of childhood affection. This the elder brother ferociously objects to, making it understood that the girl is engaged to him, so the younger boy, for the sake of peace, decides to leave the place. However, fate decrees it otherwise, for an old feud is reawakened and he joins his brother to tight the common enemy. This incident reverses conditions.",
