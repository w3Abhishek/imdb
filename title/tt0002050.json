The mountaineer inflames Sue's father against the surveyor and the old man forbids Tom to visit the premises. Some time later, Tug is given some mail addressed to Sue. Opening one of the letters, he discovers it to be a message from a promoter who has discovered that the railroad intends to lay its tracks through the girl's land. Meeting the promoter, Tug represents himself as Sue's husband and receives $10,000 on an option for the right-of-way. When Tom learns of this piece of crookedness, he hastens to the Elwood cabin. Tug, however, has poisoned old Elwood's mind and the two attack the surveyor, making him a prisoner. Tom is placed in an outbuilding until his captors can decide upon his fate. Sue, who has been locked in her room because of her refusal to marry Tug, succeeds in escaping and sees the two men imprisoning her lover. She liberates Tom and the two start for the village, where they meet the promoter and explain the situation. The treachery of Tug is exposed and Sue's father consents to allow her to marry Tom.",
