The man dies before he can make reparation for the wrong, and Ruth, left alone with the child a few months old, writes to her father beseeching him to forgive her and take her home. She returns home with her baby, a little girl, but the old man sternly refuses to have anything to do with her and casts her out with the child to beg or to starve. Ruth wanders out into the cold and snow at a loss what to do. Presently she sees the stage door of a theater open. Here she can at least get warmth and protection for her baby. She goes inside, leaves the baby in a dressing room and departs. John Redmond, who occupies the dressing room, finds the baby and adopts it. A few years later we are shown Redmond and the child enjoying a summer holiday. In the meanwhile Ruth has gone on the stage, and in the course of a few years has risen to some rank in her profession. By a strange turn of fate she joins the same company with Redmond. He falls in love with her and wants her to marry him. Thinking of her past she refuses. Later on she meets the child, hears the strange story of its adoption and recognizes it as her own. She tells Redmond. He again asks her to be his wife and this time she consents.",
