  "Plot": "At this point in the history of the movies, you could not copyright a film, so each of the production companies lifted the products from other companies..... and sometimes reshot them instead of simply taking the film into the lab and making a duplicate.This, one of the earliest survivals of Alice Guy is, of course, a remake of the Edison film ANNABELLE SERPENTINE DANCE (1895), in which the young lady swirls a lot of drapery around herself. Much the same happens here, but this being a French film, we do get to see the the dancer's ankles. Not much of a difference, agreed. Of more importance is that tinted copies of the Edison version exist, while the copy I viewed is pure black and white.",
