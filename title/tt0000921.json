  "Plot": "There is no question that the good natured man is always made the \"Patsy,\" and so it is that poor Jones, who is benignity personified, is always getting into hot water. His latest episode is an experience with a female book agent, who tried to sell him a book entitled. \"How to Be Happy, Tho' Wedded.\" The work does not appeal to affable Edward, and he with gentlemanly firmness ejects her from his office, as his friend Dick Smith enters, to whom he mimics the ludicrous antics of his visitor. All this is witnessed by this modern Clio, who is peeking through the keyhole. She vows to be revenged, and seeing a box of gloves which Jones has bought for his wife, she substitutes her corsets for the gloves, writes a note which she puts in his overcoat pocket, asking him to return her corsets, and finally sends a letter to Mrs. Jones warning her of her husband's perfidy and to search his pockets for proof. Does the scheme work? Well there seems to a certainty a case of \"Jones vs. Jones\" appearing on the calendar of the divorce court in the near future, but the book agent becomes conscience stricken and sends a letter of contrition to Mr. and Mrs. Jones, explaining everything. Peace again reigns and Jones receives the osculatory balm on his throbbing forehead.",
