Azakah's braves are constantly on the lookout for Carson, but he succeeds in eluding them for many years. Azakah has taken unto himself a white wife, who later bears him a daughter, Lat-to-nick. Eventually Carson is captured, and is about to be burned at the stake, when Lat-to-nick interferes and claims Kit as her own. The old chief accedes to the girl's wish, but places Carson under a close watch. Gradually Kit realizes that his gratitude towards Lat-to-nick has grown into a deep, all-absorbing love, and is made happy by the knowledge that it is returned in equal measure. Later, Kit hears of a plot on the part of the band, to rob and massacre the passengers of the express stage coach, and decides to prevent this at all hazards. He takes Lat-to-nick into his confidence, and she agrees to help him. They watch their opportunity and finally manage to escape. Without horses, they heroically start out overland, to warn the stage driver of the ambush that awaits him. They overtake him in the nick of time, and the Indians are beaten back. The tired and plucky couple are carried to town and the express agent shows his gratitude by uniting them in wedlock.",
