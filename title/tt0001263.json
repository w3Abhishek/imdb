  "Plot": "I had the pleasure of seeing this film tonight at MOMA, where, Mr. Anderson notes in his comments, it survives. It is a silly, rather obvious film as Miss Talmadge (who is as startlingly beautiful with long braids as she would be in a plain white apron 15 years later -- beauty is beauty) plays a princess who doesn't wish to get married to the prince from the kingdom across the tracks, nor does he want to wed her. They exchange miniature portraits, during the posing of which they each make faces. Horrified, they run away from their realms in disguise, meet each other, fall in love and return home to get married. No real surprise there.John Bunny, who would shortly become the first American comedy star has a supporting role in this movie as one of the kings. The actors perform their roles competently and charmingly.",
