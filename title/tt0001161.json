  "Plot": "A bored young man of means decides that it would be a lark to masquerade as an evangelist and preach outside the \"dance hall\" of the town in which he is living. One of the young dance hall girls hears the phony preacher and is greatly moved by his message. The girl leaves the dance hall and goes to her room, where, weeping, she kneels and prays. Her life is changed, and she now becomes a dedicated settlement house worker. One day the girl encounters the young man. He, of course, is not now in disguise; and he is falling down drunk. At first the girl is disillusioned, but then she realizes that, although his words were falsely delivered, their message was nonetheless her salvation. The young man slinks away, but now he, too, sees the light. Soon he goes out to look for the girl, and he finds her assisting an old man who has fallen on the road. Their eyes meet and we can tell that this is a new beginning for the two converts.",
