  "Plot": "The Lopez family is attacked by Indians and are all killed, excepting Juanita and her mother. Juanita hears the shooting, sees the Indians attack her home, and carry off her mother. She decides she would be safer dressed as a boy, so she dons her brother's clothes, and cuts her hair off. Then tries to reach shelter. Dick Harding, a western cowboy, comes suddenly upon Juanita. She tries to explain to him, but he does not understand Spanish, so she finally makes herself understood by gesticulations. He places her behind him on his horse, and gallops off just as the Indians dash up. After a hard ride, they outdistance the red men and reach the camp. The sheriff, Dick and cowboys pursue the Indians, and come upon them as they are in the act of burning Mother Lopez at the stake. A short fight and the Indians are defeated, but too late, as the mother is already dead. Harding then takes Juanita to his cabin, thinking she is a boy. They become very much attached to each other. Dick turns miner, and one day makes a lucky strike. Later on he learns that Juanita is a girl and realizing that he loves her, induces her to marry him.",
