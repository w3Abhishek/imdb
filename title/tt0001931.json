  "Plot": "Nell Olcott, a pretty western girl, is the proprietress of a bar and gambling hall in a little western village. Needless to say she has many admirers among the big uncouth cowpunchers and miners, who respect her wishes that none of them become drunk at her bar or gamble away all their money at her tables. One day she is annoyed by a Mexican, who is immediately ejected by Bob Griswold, a miner, whom she favors. The Mexican swears revenge and in a note to Griswold threatens to take his life. Later that day Griswold rescues an injured miner and takes him to his shack, where, like the Good Samaritan, he attends to her injuries. That night the Mexican visits Nell Olcott's bar, gags and binds her and takes her to Griswold's shack, lashing her to a post in full view of Griswold's window. He then enters the shack, binds his victim, whom he finds slumbering on a couch at the window, and after flashing the steel blade before Griswold's face is about to plunge it into his heart when the wounded miner enters the room and overcomes the would-be murderer. The Mexican is driven from the shack, where he again attempts to take the life of Nell, but is shot down by Griswold.",
