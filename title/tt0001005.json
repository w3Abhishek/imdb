  "Plot": "Cupid at times resorts to most unique methods to settle lovers' quarrels, and the subject of this comedy is possibly the most ingenious ever planned. Tom and Ethel quarrel over a most trivial matter. Despondently Tom wends his way to the beach for a dip in the cool waters as a balm to his wounded spirits. At the same time Ethel resorts to a like panacea. Each, of course, is unconscious of the other's movements. Two mischievous boys have followed them, and while the forlorn lovers are disporting (?) in the waves, the kids play the prank of exchanging the wearing apparel of the two bath houses, which are located some distance apart. Ethel finds the water cold, and is soon forced to emerge. Consternation: Well, chilled through, she is compelled to don the attire left in her bath house, Tom's suit. The same is experienced by Tom. Back to the hotel they rush through a series of ludicrous incidents, until Ethel is waylaid by a tramp, who is inclined to use violence to force her to hand over money, until Tom rushes up and rescues her from the tramp's clutches with a well-directed blow. Mr. Tramp beats it, and Tom is the hero of the day, so the two bleeding hearts are healed.",
