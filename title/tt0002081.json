He is the observed of all observers and the envy of his neighbors when they cop the style in which he is doing things. As he proceeds along the post road to Sutton, and stops at the \"Cock\" Hotel, he is IT. From Sutton to Howell, and thence to the Spread Eagle, he's the whole cheese. As he makes the journey of the hill from Howell to the downs, it is a sight long to be remembered. There are finer equipages, but none more noticeable. At the Derby he is the center of attraction and spends his money like a drunken sailor in treating his \"loidy\" to 'arf and 'arf and other refreshments. Topping off the expedition by having their fortunes told by one of the gypsies. Incidentally, Bunny has some very funny experiences, but he is a good sport, gets out of them gracefully, and quite satisfied with his day's outing. If you have ever attended the Derby, follow John Bunny in this picture and you will have the time of your life and see things that will surprise and amuse you.",
