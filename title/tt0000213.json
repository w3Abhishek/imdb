  "Plot": "DISAPPEARING ACT represents, as you might suspect, a magic act. Not any ordinary act, however. More of a \"metamorphosis\" in the hands of director Alice Guy. In the parlance of the era, the short is an example of a \"trick\" film (in that the magic performance is a result of camera trickery and not by any slight-of-hand by the performers). A trifle, perhaps, which crosses momentarily into the realm of the supernatural but nonetheless entertaining.",
