Hence it is that when Mabel is requested by mamma to accompany her to the church meeting, she sends him a note asking him to meet her after service and he may walk home with her. Muggsy is there on time all right, hut fate conspires again. The sisters Frost, two spinsters, on their way to church, were accosted by a couple of burly tramps who frightened the poor old ladies so that they were afraid to make the return trip unaccompanied. So the pastor asks that some of the men escort them. Poor Muggsy is hooked, much to his chagrin, and when the trio reach the deserted part of the road the tramps again appear. Muggsy assures the ladies of his protection, so to fear not. This declaration the tramps regard as a joke. Well the affair is on, and although Muggsy next appears in a torn, disheveled condition his opponents have to be carried bodily to the cooler, both knocked out. Mabel is justly proud of her Muggsy.",
