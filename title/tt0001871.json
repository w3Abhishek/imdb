With this in mind, he invests all his savings in the stock market, having been induced so to do by the success of an old friend in the market. He, however, is not so fortunate, for the stocks bought are dropping fast. His broker wires for $2,000 to save him from utter ruin. This, of course, he hasn't, and in the despair caused by the thought of his hopes for the future being crushed, he is about to yield to the temptation of appropriating a large amount of money left in care of the hotel proprietor by one of the guests, when his purpose is discovered by his sweetheart, whose influence saves him from the dishonorable act his desperation would have driven him to.",
