  "Plot": "Left motherless at seventeen, Mary Fuller stepped into her mother's place as not only the head, but support of the family. Her father married beneath him and had been disowned by his aristocratic family. The woman brought up her daughter with but one idea: that father's happiness was to be always the first consideration. The scion of aristocracy paid this devotion by sinking to depth after depth of ignominy until at the time of his wife's death his entire existence was spent in a drinking place. As the girl grew older, while never regardless of the injunction in her mother's Bible, to \"Honor Thy Father,\" she could not but bitterly gaze at times when her father sprawled in drunken stupor upon his couch as she forced her weary little fingers to fasten her shabby cloak about her as she made ready for another day's toil. John Hollister, a rising young attorney, finds himself looking into the eyes of the first girl that ever cost him a second thought. Her fianc\u00e9's introduction to her father took place under circumstances so terrible that the girl felt only one thing could be done, return Jack his ring and freedom and then once more wearily take up the burden of her former life, but Fortune again throws a careless trick upon the table and out of misery and tears Mary rises to her lover's heart.",
