  "Plot": "Old man Harding has a palatial residence, keeping a number of servants, including a French butler and chef. He is called away one day, expecting to be gone for several weeks, and the ambitious butler unfolds a plan to the chef by which he hopes to marry a wealthy girl. A widow and her daughter have just taken a house nearby, and the butler sends the chef with a note inviting them to dinner, signed with the name of a fictitious count. The women accept the invitation, and the butler arrays himself in the frock coat of his master and prepares to receive them. He secures the co-operation of the other servants, whom he has promised to reward handsomely if he wins the rich girl's hand. Everything goes well until the bogus count begins to think he is really a great man, and his arrogance towards the chef arouses that worthy's ire, and he decides to spoil the butler's plan. He gets one of the servants to attire himself in another suit of their master, and he comes upon the scene. Much comedy results and a duel is fought with table knives. Into the midst of this melee Harding comes home, and the crestfallen servants are discharged.",
