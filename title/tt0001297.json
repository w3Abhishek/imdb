The husband, one of the miners in the camp, dies, and the rough men gather to tell her of her loss. She does not survive the news long, and the little child is left alone. How the miners take up a collection for the \"kid\" contributing personal ornaments, revolvers, knives and even a whisky bottle, is laughable. Finally, the child, in playing near the camp, discovers gold, and this leads to its formal adoption by the camp.",
