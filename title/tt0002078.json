Some, as in the case of the brute, pass through life dominated alone by brute force, until there comes a regenerating influence arousing the latent good. Into his life first comes the instinctive attraction for the coquetry of the maid, but the strength she may have fancied she admired in him turns into gross brutality, subduing her hidden spirit. Then two tickets for the theater change the entire course of his life. The Bill Sikes in the play holds up the mirror to the Bill Sikes in life, and both man and wife are born anew.",
