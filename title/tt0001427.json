But Bob is an excellent hand and Molly is going away, so Mr. Hendricks keeps Bob on. However, after one year Molly is coming back home; and Bob makes no secret of the fact that his feelings haven't changed. Daddy and Bob get into a heated argument which proves too much for the old man's heart, and he dies. Now everyone thinks that Bob has killed him in some way, so Bob flees for his life to the mountains. Now wouldn't you know it, Molly is coming back through those very mountains and she is attacked by Indians. It's faithful Bob to the rescue, and Molly is saved. Now Bob decides that he must bring Molly safely home, knowing that this act will probably cost him his life. And it would have too. Only the coroner arrives in the nick of time with the news that Daddy's death was due to natural causes; and Bob is saved from a neck-tie-party.",
