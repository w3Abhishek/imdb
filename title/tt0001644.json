One day they receive a letter from Dorris Dean, a girl whom they both love, asking one of them to come to her assistance, as she is in trouble. They toss a coin to see who shall go, and Jack wins, but later, knowing that Tom will never recover from the blow, he leaves a note telling the other that he will give up all claims to the girl and that Tom should go back. Tom sees Jack leaving the house and thinks he is going back east. In his intense jealousy he shoots Jack from behind, but wounds him slightly. Deeply repentant when he learns of Jack's former sacrifice, he urges Jack to go back and Jack consents to do so. The boys exchange guns as tokens of remembrance and it is then that he learns that it was Jack who shot him. At first moved to have revenge, he later suppresses the desire and goes on to the girl back east.",
