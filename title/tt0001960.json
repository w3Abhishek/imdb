Pleadings are in vain, for the boy is fascinated, and so the sorrowing mother, feeling she has lost all that she has lived for, determines upon self-destruction and is prevented only by the timely appearance of her visiting friend, who devises the plan that awakens the boy. She has the mother pretend suicide on account of the loss of fortune. This shows the boy the true nature and design of the object of his infatuation.",
