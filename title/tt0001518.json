Broncho Billy takes the wounded man's part and makes the tavern-keeper provide a bed for him, while the doctor is sent for. The others are determined to lynch the tavern-keeper, but are prevented from doing so by Broncho Billy, who, however, declares that if the girl's sweetheart dies, he will turn her father over to the wounded man's pals. Luckily, the young man recovers and the old tavern-keeper is persuaded to give the young couple his blessing.",
