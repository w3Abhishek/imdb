  "Plot": "A young author comes to spend the summer at the homestead, and becomes quite impressed by Jennie and Alice, the two daughters of his hostess. He is, however, rather impartial in his attentions, though Jennie fancies she is the favored one. On the evening of his departure, Mamma and Papa go for a visit, to be away overnight. The sisters have several of their girlfriends to come and keep them company for the night. An ugly looking tramp, appreciating the favorable opportunity, breaks in, frightening the girls, with the exception of Alice, out of their wits. She, learning that her sister's locket is downstairs in easy access, braves the danger to get it, by pretending to be sleep-walking. Her scheme works until she tries to overpower the burglar. She puts up a stubborn fight, which terminated in her favor, for the author returns for his forgotten suitcase. The author is not long in realizing who is the real one of the sisters, much to Jennie's chagrin, who makes a bluff at self-destruction, but her rube sweetheart says, \"Don't do it,\" and she \"don't.\"",
