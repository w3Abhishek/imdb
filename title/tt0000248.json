  "Plot": "Consisting of three brief shots--an opening point-of-view scene with the camera fixed to the front of the locomotive, or \"Phantom Ride\"; a saucy middle shot, and a closing scene--pioneer filmmaker George Albert Smith's original short is an excellent example of early continuity editing, which eloquently portrays a loving couple's impromptu expression of affection. As the train enters a short and dark tunnel, the husband decides to display his tenderness with a gentle caress on his wife's chin--and moments later--one joyful peck on the lips leads to another, and then, yet another one, against the backdrop of (simulated) total darkness. Is a daring kiss in the tunnel what it takes to keep his charming lady smiling for the rest of the journey?",
