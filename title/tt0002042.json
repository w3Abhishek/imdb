Eleanor knows her little book and makes a grab for Roland. They become engaged. It so happens that at the hotel, which the bachelor calls \"home,\" comes Mrs. Fair, a fascinating young widow, her little baby and maid. Roland calls on Eleanor for an auto ride. To his intense astonishment, he discovers the baby sound asleep on one of the limousine's seats; the widow's maid had placed it there by mistake. Eleanor promptly jumps at conclusions and accuses her fianc\u00e9 of being its father. The bachelor, not knowing what to do with the baby, takes it to his room. Meanwhile the baby's disappearance greatly upsets the widow. Hotel proprietor and detectives come to the rescue, but alas, despite their united and energetic efforts, baby cannot be found. Bachelor and baby get along famously until the letter's dinner hour arrives; then, well, then Roland is obliged to enlist someone's aid. This leads to the re-union of mother and child and later to the union of widow and bachelor. Baby will no longer be fatherless.",
