  "Plot": "jovial looking man is seated nearest the window of a restaurant. He has just finished his meal and the waiter brings a glass of beer, and when he places the glass upon the table, lo, a little sailor boy about six inches high appears from the foam, and climbing down the side of the glass, proceeds to dance a sailor's hornpipe on the table. The sailor then walks toward a large cake of cheese, which is really higher than himself, and from the wedge shaped opening which has been cut, produces a little lady of his own height, with whom he holds a very animated conversation to the great delight of the diner. Another little man appears on the scene, and everything goes smoothly until a quarrel arises among the little people. The picture finishes in an exciting manner, by the sailor and the lady's escort having a lively mix-up. This is one of the most comical effects ever produced in animated photography.",
