  "Plot": "The night was auspicious for a lover who could both do and dare, and the tall, handsome, manly youth who had secreted himself in the shrubbery felt that his plans were now to be crowned with success. The cruel father who had forbidden him the house was incautiously taking his departure for an evening at the millionaire's club, and the sweet girl upon whom our hero lavished his affections had given him the signal that the coast was clear. But, ah! Alas for love's stratagem, the \"Angel Child,\" whom he had quite forgotten, was wide awake and on the job! How she overheard their plans for an elopement, how she locked her sister in her room and how she dropped the key down the hero's back, are better seen than described. And how love found a way in spite of the \"Angel Child's\" precocious vigilance is a part of the story which should not be told in advance. Enough to say this is one of the few comedies in which the child plays the principal part, and in which, aside from the fun of the individual scenes, there is an intensely interesting and laughable story moving rapidly and humorously to a \"thrilling\" climax.",
