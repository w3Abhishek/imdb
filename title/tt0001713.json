  "Plot": "An over-domesticated husband leaves for the office, and while there several friends try to persuade him to go on a fishing trip, but he answers, \"No, boys, my wife won't let me.\" They say, \"We'll fix that.\" So taking him to a doctor friend, they form a plan. The doctor tells him to go home and pretend he is seized with a nervous affliction, and his wife is sure to telephone for him. The scheme works great and the doctor, upon arriving, insists that the husband must go away at once, attended only by a nurse he will select. Peace and quiet are what he needs. The nurse is one of the fishing party, and away they go, on a wild ride for the beach. The husband is now at the shore, having the time of her life, while at home his mother has been taken very ill. Wifey goes for the doctor, but he happens to be away in the country, so she hastens there in an auto to get him. On the return trip they pass the spot where hubby is enjoying \"peace and quiet.\" They don't see hubby, but hubby sees them, and maybe he doesn't get excited. Well, the chase after that auto baffles description; and the arrival home, no more \"peace and quiet: for hubby for some time.",
