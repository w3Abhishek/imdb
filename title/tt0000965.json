  "Plot": "A burglar has entered the top story of a flat by means of the lire escape, and has the misfortune to arouse the occupants. They give chase, forcing the burglar to return to the fire-escape for an exit. Being closely pursued, the thief is compelled to enter the next window below, arousing the tenant in his hasty endeavor to get away. The pursuers are joined by the person disturbed, and the culprit is again forced to make the fire-escape. In and out the windows, on and off the fire-escape, the unfortunate burglar is pursued by the ever-increasing mob, through the hallways, knocking everyone down that comes between him and his freedom. At last his Nemesis appears in the shape of a bulldog, who follows him with a persistency that brings about his capture. A German policeman figures prominently in the picture, also a gentleman about to take a bath. The following crowd is dressed in a variety of costumes that adds greatly to the comical events. All the action takes place either in the interiors or upon the fire-escape in mid-air.",
