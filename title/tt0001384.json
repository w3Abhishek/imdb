The two young fellows are rivals for the hand of a pretty girl of the village, and after her marriage with the one of her choice, the other swears to be revenged. To effect this he pours chemically treated oil into the irrigation ditches of the husband's farm. This of course ruins the land for vegetation, but it brings the husband a fabulous hum from a speculator in oil lands, who thinks he has struck a highly productive oil field. (transcribed from 1910 newspaper ad - p.d.)",
