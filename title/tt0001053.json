In this Biograph subject is shown an exemplification of the theory, with rather better results than is usually attendant upon vengeful moves. The young man jilts his first sweetheart to marry another. He apprises her of this by leaving a newspaper containing the notice of his approaching marriage. She flies into a frenzy of rage, and for revenge dispatches a messenger boy to the bride-elect with a package of his love letters and a joint photograph of themselves. The boy departs and she follows with her mind's eye this bearer of her malice, when suddenly her hand falls upon one of his gloves on the table. This is like a shock, for she now realizes the woe she has apparently caused. What would she not do to recall the messenger, but fate has intervened, for the boy has accidentally dropped the package from a bridge into the river.",
