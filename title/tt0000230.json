  "Plot": "This George M\u00e9li\u00e8s' extraordinary fairy-tale film adaptation of author Charles Perrault's \"Cendrillon\", is considered to be the first film to use a dissolve transition in-between scenes. With the use of twenty masterly coloured engravings by Gustave Dor\u00e9 to illustrate the storyline's interchanging scenes, the director portrays Cinderella's well-known story, as the Fairy Godmother works her magic, transforming a poor and ragged girl to a fine aristocratic Lady at the King's Ball. In less than seven minutes, everything is here: from the magnificent magical carriage and the jealous sisters, to the noble Prince Charming and the dainty slipper. Of course, here too, time is of the essence.",
