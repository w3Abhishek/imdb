Jim and John being lifelong chums, Jim is amazed at what he imagines to be blatant perfidy in his wife and friend. He espies them whispering together on several occasions, but the apparently convincing evidence is the slipping of a note into the hand of John by the wife, while she visits their place of work, with their luncheon. This decides Jim, and he rushes home, arms himself with a gun, declaring they shall both die. You may imagine his surprise when, as he is about to assassinate the pair, they load him with presents, it being his birthday, which he had forgotten. Their little intrigues were in making the arrangement, and the note was a list of things for John to get.",
